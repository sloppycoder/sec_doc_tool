[SIDEBAR]

TOTAL RETURN

An investment objective of selecting securities with the potential to rise in
price and/or pay out income.
[/SIDEBAR]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES


[CHESS GRAPHIC OMITTED] The Fund's "Investment Manager," Morgan Stanley
Investment Advisors Inc., actively allocates the Fund's assets among the three
major asset categories of equity securities (including depositary receipts),
fixed-income securities and money market instruments, the combination of which
will be varied from time to time both with respect to industry sector weightings
and types of securities in response to changing market and economic trends.
There is no limit as to the percentage of assets that may be allocated to any
one asset class. The Fund may invest 100% of its assets in any one of the three
major asset categories mentioned above at any time. It is anticipated that there
will be significant fluctuations in the allocations over time and thus, the Fund
may exhibit higher volatility than other funds.

The Investment Manager intends to utilize an investment process to select
equities and fixed-income securities that is designed to respond to changing
market and economic cycles. First, the Investment Manager attempts to identify
what stage of the cycle the economy is in and to identify which sectors within
both equities and fixed-income have historically outperformed the overall
market during that stage of the cycle. To accomplish this task, the Investment
Manager establishes an economic outlook based on its short-term and long-term
views of the domestic and global economic cycles. As part of this process, the
Investment Manager will attempt to identify those equity and fixed-income
sectors it believes offer the best relative performance based on this economic
outlook. The next step of the investment process entails an analysis of the
industries within each sector to determine which are the most attractive.
Specific stocks or corporate debt securities are selected in part based on
company size and various valuation metrics.

Within the equity asset category, the Investment Manager invests in those
industries that it believes are the most attractive given the projected
economic outlook.


Within the fixed-income asset category, the Investment Manager intends to
rotate investments among various types of fixed-income securities (e.g.
governments and agencies (including zeroes), corporates and high-yield bonds
(commonly know as "junk bonds")) and across various maturities.


                                                                               1

<PAGE>


Within the money market asset category, the Investment Manager invests in
short-term high-quality money market instruments.


Securities in which the Fund may invest include common stocks, preferred
stocks, index-based baskets of securities, convertible securities, investment
grade debt securities, U.S. government securities, mortgage-backed securities,
including collateralized mortgage obligations (commonly known as "CMOs"),
asset-backed securities, real estate investment trusts (commonly known as
"REITs"), high-yield bonds and money market instruments. The Fund is not
limited as to the maturities of the U.S. government securities and other debt
securities in which it may invest. The Fund's investments also may include
"Rule 144A" securities, which are subject to resale restrictions.

The Fund may invest in futures to facilitate the reallocation of its assets.
For example, the Investment Manager may believe that the Fund should increase
its fixed-income investments by a certain amount and decrease its equity
investments by the same amount. The Investment Manager may consequently
purchase interest rate futures, such as Treasury bond futures, and sell stock
index futures, such as S&P 500 Stock Index futures, in equal amounts -- rather
than purchase and sell fixed-income and equity securities. Futures also may be
used to facilitate trading, to increase or decrease the Fund's market exposure,
or to seek to protect against a decline in the value of the Fund's securities
or an increase in prices of securities that may be purchased.

In addition, the Fund may invest in securities issued by foreign governments
and foreign private issuers, including emerging market securities (held either
directly or in the form of depositary receipts). Such securities may include
common stocks and other equity securities (including depository receipts),
fixed-income securities (including zero coupon securities) and Yankee and
Eurobond obligations. However, the Fund only may invest up to 25% of its net
assets in foreign securities that are not listed in the United States on a
national securities exchange (of this 25%, up to 5% may be invested in emerging
market securities).


Equity securities in which the Fund may invest include common and preferred
stock. Common stock is a share ownership or equity interest in a corporation.
It may or may not pay dividends, as some companies reinvest all of their
profits back into their businesses, while others pay out some of their profits
to shareholders as dividends. A depositary receipt is generally issued by a
bank or financial institution and represents an ownership interest in the
common stock or other equity securities of a foreign company. Preferred stock
pays dividends at a specified rate and has preference over common stock in the
payment of dividends. While the Fund principally invests in large, established
companies, the Fund may invest in medium-sized and small-sized companies.

Fixed-income securities in which the Fund may invest include debt securities
such as U.S. government securities, investment-grade corporate bonds and notes,
mortgage-backed securities, including collateralized mortgage-backed
obligations, asset-backed securities, U.S. dollar-denominated securities issued
by foreign governments or foreign private issuers and high-yield bonds. The
issuer of the debt security borrows money from the investor who buys the
security. Most debt securities pay either fixed or adjustable rates of interest
at regular intervals until they mature, at which point investors get their
principal back. The Fund's fixed-income investments may include zero coupon
securities, which are purchased at a discount and generally accrue interest,
but make no payments until maturity.

The mortgage-backed securities in which the Fund may invest include mortgage
pass-through securities which represent a participation interest in a pool of
mortgage loans originated by U.S. governmental or private lenders


2

<PAGE>


such as banks. These securities may be collateralized by mortgages with fixed,
variable or floating rates. They differ from conventional debt securities which
provide for periodic payment of interest in fixed amounts and principal
payments at maturity or on specific call dates. Mortgage pass-through
securities provide for monthly payments that are a "pass-through" of the
monthly interest and principal payments made by the individual borrowers on the
pooled mortgage loans. Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) are debt
obligations issued in multiple classes that are collateralized by mortgage
loans or mortgage pass-through securities (collectively "Mortgage Assets").
Payments of principal and interest on the Mortgage Assets and any reinvestment
income are used to make payments on the CMOs. Each class of CMO has a fixed or
floating rate and a stated maturity or final distribution date. The principal
and interest on the Mortgage Assets may be allocated among the classes in a
number of different ways. Certain classes with more predictable cash flow will
have a lower yield and classes with less predictable cash flow will have a
higher yield and greater risk. The Fund may invest in any class of CMO.


Asset-backed securities represent an interest in a pool of assets such as
automobile and credit card receivables or home equity loans that have been
securitized in pass-through structures similar to mortgage-backed securities.
REITs pool investors' funds for investments primarily in commercial real estate
properties.


The Fund may engage in transactions in listed and over the counter ("OTC")
options. The Fund also may invest in exchange-traded funds ("ETFs") and may
engage in swaps.


In pursuing the Fund's investment objective, the Investment Manager has
considerable leeway in deciding which investments it buys, holds or sells on a
day-to-day basis -- and which principal investment strategies or other
strategies or investment techniques it uses. For example, the Investment
Manager in its discretion may determine to use some permitted trading or
investment strategies while not using others.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRINCIPAL RISKS


[SCALES GRAPHIC OMITTED] There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its
investment objective. The Fund's share price and return will fluctuate with
changes in the market value of the Fund's portfolio securities. When you sell
Fund shares, they may be worth less than what you paid for them and,
accordingly, you can lose money investing in this Fund.

SECURITY SELECTION. The Investment Manager actively allocates the Fund's assets
among the three major asset categories. Specifically, the Investment Manager
tries to determine the mix of equities, fixed-income securities and money
market instruments that offers what it believes to be the best combination of
potential return and risk. At any given time, the Investment Manager may
allocate all, a portion, or none of the Fund's assets to equities, fixed-income
securities and money market instruments. There are no limitations on the amount
of the Fund's assets that may be allocated to equities, fixed-income securities
or money market instruments; it can be up to 100% invested in any one of the
three asset categories.

Because the Fund's asset allocation changes according to the Investment
Manager's economic outlook, the Fund may exhibit much higher volatility than
other funds. There can be no assurance that the Investment Manager will
consistently anticipate which asset category will perform best in the future.


                                                                               3

<PAGE>

The Fund's investment results could suffer, for example, if only a small
portion of the Fund's assets were allocated to equities during a significant
stock market advance, or if a major portion of its assets were allocated to
equities during a market decline. Similarly, the Fund's short-term investment
results could also suffer if the Fund were substantially invested in bonds at a
time when interest rates increased. The Fund is generally managed without
regard to tax ramifications.

COMMON STOCKS AND OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES. A principal risk of investing in the
Fund is associated with its stock and other equity investments. In general,
stock values fluctuate in response to activities specific to the company as
well as general market, economic and political conditions. Stock prices can
fluctuate widely in response to these factors. The Fund's emphasis on
industries may cause its performance to be more sensitive to developments
affecting particular industries than a fund that places primary emphasis on
individual companies.

While the Fund principally invests in large, established companies, the Fund
may invest in medium-sized companies and small-sized companies. Investing in
securities of medium and small-sized companies involves greater risk than is
customarily associated with investing in more established companies. Often, the
stocks of these companies, particularly small companies, may be more volatile
and less liquid than the stocks of more established companies and may be
subject to more abrupt and erratic price movements. These stocks may have
returns that vary, sometimes significantly, from the overall stock market.
Often smaller and medium capitalization companies and the industries in which
they are focused are still evolving and, while this may offer better growth
potential than larger, more established companies, it also may make them more
sensitive to changing market conditions.

FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. A principal risk of investing in the Fund is
associated with its fixed-income investments. All fixed-income securities are
subject to two types of risk: credit risk and interest rate risk. Credit risk
refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will be unable to make
interest payments and/or repay the principal on its debt.

Interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income
security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. When
the general level of interest rates goes up, the prices of most fixed-income
securities go down. When the general level of interest rates goes down, the
prices of most fixed-income securities go up. (Zero coupon securities are
typically subject to greater price fluctuations than comparable securities that
pay current interest.)

The Fund is not limited as to the maturities of the fixed-income securities in
which it may invest. Thus, a rise in the general level of interest rates may
cause the price of the Fund's portfolio securities to fall substantially.


COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS ("CMOS"). The principal and interest on the
Mortgage Assets comprising a CMO may be allocated among the several classes of
a CMO in many ways. The general goal in allocating cash flows on Mortgage
Assets to the various classes of a CMO is to create certain tranches on which
the expected cash flows have a higher degree of predictability than do the
underlying Mortgage Assets. As a general matter, the more predictable the cash
flow is on a particular CMO tranche, the lower the anticipated yield on that
tranche at the time of issue will be relative to the prevailing market yields
on the Mortgage Assets. As part of the process of creating more predictable
cash flows on certain tranches of a CMO, one or more tranches generally must be
created that absorb most of the changes in the cash flows on the underlying
Mortgage Assets. The yields on



4

<PAGE>

these tranches are generally higher than prevailing market yields on other
mortgage related securities with similar average lives. Principal prepayments
on the underlying Mortgage Assets may cause the CMOs to be retired
substantially earlier than their stated maturities or final distribution dates.
Because of the uncertainty of the cash flows on these tranches, the market
prices and yields of these tranches are more volatile and may increase or
decrease in value substantially with changes in interest rates and/or the rates
of prepayment. Due to the possibility that prepayments (on home mortgages and
other collateral) will alter the cash flow on CMOs, it is not possible to
determine in advance the final maturity date or average life. Faster prepayment
will shorten the average life and slower prepayments will lengthen it. In
addition, if the collateral securing CMOs or any third party guarantees are
insufficient to make payments, the Fund could sustain a loss.

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. Mortgage-backed securities in which the Fund may
invest have different risk characteristics than traditional debt securities.
Although generally, the value of fixed-income securities increases during
periods of falling interest rates and decreases during periods of rising rates,
this is not always the case with mortgage-backed securities. This is due to the
fact that principal on underlying mortgages may be prepaid at any time, as well
as other factors. Generally, prepayments will increase during a period of
falling interest rates and decrease during a period of rising interest rates.
The rate of prepayments also may be influenced by economic and other factors.
Prepayment risk includes the possibility that, as interest rates fall,
securities with stated interest rates may have the principal prepaid earlier
than expected, requiring the Fund to invest the proceeds at generally lower
interest rates.

Investments in mortgage-backed securities are made based upon, among other
things, expectations regarding the rate of prepayments on underlying mortgage
pools. Rates of prepayment, faster or slower than expected by the Investment
Manager, could reduce the Fund's yield, increase the volatility of the Fund
and/or cause a decline in net asset value. Certain mortgage-backed securities
may be more volatile and less liquid than other traditional types of debt
securities.

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES. Asset-backed securities have risk characteristics
similar to mortgage-backed securities. Like mortgage-backed securities, they
generally decrease in value as a result of interest rate increases, but may
benefit less than other fixed-income securities from declining interest rates,
principally because of prepayments. Also, as in the case of mortgage-backed
securities, prepayments generally increase during a period of declining
interest rates although other factors, such as changes in credit use and
payment patterns, may also influence prepayment rates. Asset-backed securities
also involve the risk that various federal and state consumer laws and other
legal and economic factors may result in the collateral backing the securities
being insufficient to support payment on the securities.


REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS ("REITS"). Like mutual funds, REITs have
expenses, including advisory and administration fees, that are paid by their
shareholders. As a result, you will absorb duplicate levels of fees when the
Fund invests in REITs. The performance of any REIT holdings ultimately depends
on the types of real property in which the REITs invest and how well the
property is managed. A general downturn in real estate values also can hurt
REIT performance. In addition, REITs are subject to certain provisions under
federal tax law. The failure of a company to qualify as a REIT could have
adverse consequences for the Fund, including significantly reducing return to
the Fund on its investment in such company.



                                                                               5


<PAGE>

FUTURES.  The market value of futures may represent a substantial portion of
the Fund's assets. If the Fund invests in futures, its participation in these
markets would subject the Fund's portfolio to certain risks. The Investment
Manager's predictions of movements in the direction of the stock and/or
fixed-income markets may be inaccurate, and the adverse consequences to the
Fund (e.g., a reduction in the Fund's net asset value or a reduction in the
amount of income available for distribution) may leave the Fund in a worse
position than if these strategies were not used. Losses (or gains) involving
futures can sometimes be substantial -- in part because a relatively small
price movement in a futures contract may result in an immediate and substantial
loss (or gain) for a fund. Other risks inherent in the use of futures include,
for example, the possible imperfect correlation between the price of futures
contracts and movements in the prices of securities, and the possible absence
of a liquid secondary market for any particular instrument.

HIGH YIELD SECURITIES (JUNK BONDS). The Fund may invest up to 5% of its net
assets in high yield securities (commonly known as "junk bonds"). Junk bonds
are subject to greater risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated
securities. The prices of junk bonds are likely to be more sensitive to adverse
economic changes or individual corporate developments than higher rated
securities. During an economic downturn or substantial period of rising
interest rates, junk bond issuers and, in particular, highly leveraged issuers
may experience financial stress that would adversely affect their ability to
service their principal and interest payment obligations, to meet their
projected business goals or to obtain additional financing. In the event of a
default, the Fund may incur additional expenses to seek recovery. The secondary
market for junk bonds may be less liquid than the markets for higher quality
securities and, as such, may have an adverse effect on the market prices of
certain securities. The Rule 144A securities could have the effect of
increasing the level of Fund illiquidity to the extent the Fund may be unable
to find qualified institutional buyers interested in purchasing the securities.
The illiquidity of the market may also adversely affect the ability of the
Fund's Trustees to arrive at a fair value for certain junk bonds at certain
times and could make it difficult for the Fund to sell certain securities. In
addition, periods of economic uncertainty and change probably would result in
an increased volatility of market prices of high yield securities and a
corresponding volatility in the Fund's net asset value. In addition to junk
bonds, the Fund may also invest in certain investment grade fixed-income
securities. Some of these securities have speculative characteristics.

CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES. The Fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets in
convertible securities. Investments in convertible securities can subject the
Fund to the risks associated with both fixed-income securities and common
stocks. To the extent that a convertible security's investment value is greater
than its conversion value, its price will likely increase when interest rates
fall and decrease when interest rates rise, as with a fixed-income security. If
the conversion value exceeds the investment value, the price of the convertible
security will tend to fluctuate directly with the price of the underlying
equity security. The Rule 144A securities could have the effect of increasing
the level of Fund illiquidity to the extent the Fund may be unable to find
qualified institutional buyers interested in purchasing the securities. In the
aggregate, the Fund may not invest more than 10% of its net assets in
securities rated below investment grade, including high yield securities and
convertible securities rated below investment grade.


The Fund may invest up to 10% of its net assets in "synthetic" and
"exchangeable" convertible securities. Unlike traditional convertible
securities whose conversion values are based on the common stock of the issuer
of the convertible security, "synthetic" and "exchangeable" convertible
securities are preferred stocks or debt obligations of



6


<PAGE>


an issuer which are combined with an equity component whose conversion value is
based on the value of the common stock of a different issuer or a particular
benchmark (which may include a foreign issuer or basket of foreign stocks, or a
company whose stock is not yet publicly traded). In many cases, "synthetic" and
"exchangeable" convertible securities are not convertible prior to maturity, at
which time the value of the security is paid in cash by the issuer. There are
also special risks associated with the Fund's investments in "synthetic" and
"exchangeable" convertible securities. These securities may be more volatile
and less liquid than traditional convertible securities.


FOREIGN SECURITIES. The Fund's investments in foreign securities may involve
risks in addition to the risks associated with domestic securities. One
additional risk is currency risk. While the price of Fund shares is quoted in
U.S. dollars, the Fund generally converts U.S. dollars to a foreign market's
local currency to purchase a security in that market. If the value of that
local currency falls relative to the U.S. dollar, the U.S. dollar value of the
foreign security will decrease. This is true even if the foreign security's
local price remains unchanged.

Foreign securities (including U.S. dollar-denominated foreign securities) also
have risks related to economic and political developments abroad, including
expropriations, confiscatory taxation, exchange control regulation, limitations
on the use or transfer of Fund assets and any effects of foreign social,
economic or political instability. Foreign companies, in general, are not
subject to the regulatory requirements of U.S. companies and, as such, there
may be less publicly available information about these companies. Moreover,
foreign accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards generally are
different from those applicable to U.S. companies. Finally, in the event of a
default of any foreign debt obligations, it may be more difficult for the Fund
to obtain or enforce a judgment against the issuers of the securities.

Securities of foreign issuers may be less liquid than comparable securities of
U.S. issuers and, as such, their price changes may be more volatile.
Furthermore, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers are generally subject to less
government and exchange scrutiny and regulation than their U.S. counterparts.
In addition, differences in clearance and settlement procedures in foreign
markets may occasion delays in settlement of the Fund's trades effected in
those markets and could result in losses to the Fund due to subsequent declines
in the value of the securities subject to the trades.

Depositary receipts involve substantially identical risks to those associated
with direct investment in foreign securities. In addition, the underlying
issuers of certain depositary receipts, particularly unsponsored or
unregistered depositary receipts, are under no obligation to distribute
shareholder communications to the holders of such receipts, or to pass through
to them any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities.


Certain foreign securities in which the Fund may invest may be issued by
companies located in developing or emerging countries. Compared to the United
States and other developed countries, developing or emerging countries may have
relatively unstable governments, economies based on only a few industries and
securities markets that trade a small number of securities. Securities issued
by companies located in these countries tend to be especially volatile and may
be less liquid than securities traded in developed countries. In the past,
securities in these countries have offered greater potential loss (as well as
gain) than securities of companies located in developed countries.



                                                                               7

<PAGE>

NON-DIVERSIFIED STATUS. The Fund is a "non-diversified" mutual fund and, as
such, its investments are not required to meet certain diversification
requirements under federal law. Compared with "diversified" funds, the Fund may
invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of an individual
corporation or governmental entity. Thus, the Fund's assets may be concentrated
in fewer securities than other funds. A decline in the value of those
investments would cause the Fund's overall value to decline to a greater
degree.


PORTFOLIO TURNOVER. The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of its
portfolio securities. A portfolio turnover rate of 400%, for example, is
equivalent to the Fund buying and selling all of its portfolio securities four
times during the course of the year. A high portfolio turnover rate (over 100%)
could result in high brokerage costs and an increase in taxable capital gains
distributions to the Fund's shareholders. See the sections on "Distributions"
and "Tax Consequences."

OTHER RISKS. The performance of the Fund also will depend on whether the
Investment Manager is successful in applying the Fund's investment strategies.
The Fund is subject to other risks from its permissible investments, other than
its principal investment strategies, including the risks associated with
options transactions, ETFs and swaps. For more information about these risks,
see the "Additional Risk Information" section.


Shares of the Fund are not bank deposits and are not guaranteed or insured by
the FDIC or any other government agency.


The Fund commenced operations on February 26, 2003 and, as of the date of this
Prospectus, did not have a full calendar year of performance to report.
Performance information for the Fund will be presented once the Fund has
completed investment operations for a full calendar year.

EXAMPLE

This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund
with the cost of investing in other mutual funds.


The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund, your investment has a
5% return each year, and the Fund's operating expenses remain the same.
Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, the tables below show your
costs at the end of each period based on these assumptions, depending upon
whether or not you sell your shares at the end of each period.

While Class B and Class C shares do not have any front-end sales charges, their
higher ongoing annual expenses (due to higher 12b-1 fees) mean that over time
you could end up paying more for these shares than if you were to pay front-end
sales charges for Class A shares.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY INFORMATION


[CHESS GRAPHIC OMITTED] This section provides additional information relating to
the Fund's principal investment strategies.

FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. The Fund's investments also may
include forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which involve the purchase
or sale of a specific amount of foreign currency at the current price with
delivery at a specified future date. The Fund may use these contracts to hedge
against adverse movements in the foreign currencies in which portfolio
securities are denominated. In addition, the Fund may use these instruments to
modify its exposure to various currency markets.

OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS. The Fund may purchase listed and OTC call and put options
on equity, fixed-income and index-based securities. Listed options are issued
or guaranteed by the exchange on which they are traded or by a clearing
corporation such as the Options Clearing Corporation. OTC options are purchased
from or sold (written) to dealers or financial institutions which have entered
into direct agreements with the Fund. The Fund is permitted to write covered
call options on portfolio securities and may write covered put options.

EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS ("ETFS"). The Fund may invest up to 10% of its net assets
in shares of various ETFs that seek to track the performance of various
portions or segments of the equity and bond markets. No more than 5% of the
Fund's net assets will be invested in any one ETF.



10


<PAGE>

SWAPS. Swap transactions are contracts in which the Fund agrees to exchange the
return or interest rate on one instrument for the return or interest rate on
another instrument. The payment streams are calculated by reference to a
specified index and agreed upon notational amount. A "specified index" may
include currencies, interest rates, fixed-income indices, securities indices,
total return on interest rate indices or commodity indices. Swaps may be used
to manage the maturity and duration of a fixed-income portfolio, or to gain
exposure to a market without directly investing in securities traded in that
market. Currency swaps generally involve an agreement to pay interest streams
in one currency based on a specified index in exchange for receiving interest
streams denominated in another currency. Interest rate caps, floors and collars
are swaps in which one party pays a single or periodic fixed amount or premium
and the other party pays periodic amounts based on the movement of a specified
index.


The percentage limitations relating to the composition of the Fund's portfolio
apply at the time the Fund acquires an investment. Subsequent percentage
changes that result from market fluctuations will generally not require the
Fund to sell any portfolio security. However, the Fund may be required to sell
its illiquid securities holdings, if any, in response to fluctuations in the
value of such holdings. The Fund may change its principal investment strategies
without shareholder approval; however, you would be notified of any changes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION


[SCALES GRAPHIC OMITTED] This section provides additional information relating
to the principal risks of investing in the Fund.

FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. Use of forward foreign currency
exchange contracts involves risks. If the Investment Manager employs a strategy
that does not correlate well with the Fund's investments or the currencies in
which the investments are denominated, currency contracts could result in a
loss. The contracts also may increase the Fund's volatility and, thus, could
involve a significant risk.

RISKS OF OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS. The successful use of options depends on the
ability of the Investment Manager to forecast correctly interest rates and/or
market movements. If the market value of the portfolio securities upon which
call options have been written increases, the Fund may receive a lower total
return from the portion of its portfolio upon which calls have been written
than it would have had such calls not been written. During the option period,
the covered call writer has, in return for the premium on the option, given up
the opportunity for capital appreciation above the exercise price should the
market price of the underlying security increase, but has retained the risk of
loss should the price of the underlying security decline. The covered put
writer also retains the risk of loss should the market value of the underlying
security decline below the exercise price of the option less the premium
received on the sale of the option. In both cases, the writer has no control
over the time when it may be required to fulfill its obligation as a writer of
the option. Prior to exercise or expiration, an option position can only be
terminated by entering into a closing purchase or sale transaction. Once an
option writer has received an exercise notice, it cannot effect a closing
purchase transaction in order to terminate its obligation under the option and
must deliver or receive the underlying securities at the exercise price.

The Fund's ability to close out its position as a writer of an option is
dependent upon the existence of a liquid secondary market on option exchanges.
There is no assurance that such a market will exist.



                                                                              11


<PAGE>


EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS ("ETFS"). Shares of exchange-traded funds have many of
the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds. In addition,
their market value is expected to rise and fall as the value of the underlying
index or bonds rises and falls. The market value of their shares may differ
from the net asset value of the particular fund. If the Fund invests in shares
of ETFs it would, in addition to its own expenses, indirectly bear its ratable
share of the ETF's expenses (e.g., advisory, administrative or 12b-1 fees). In
addition, the Fund would have increased market exposure to those companies held
in its portfolio that are also held by the ETF.

SWAPS. Swaps do not involve the delivery of securities, other underlying assets
or principal. Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to swaps is limited to
the net amount of payments that the Fund is contractually obligated to make,
or, in the case of the other party to a swap defaulting, the net amount of
payments that the Fund is contractually entitled to receive. Currency swaps
usually involve the delivery of the entire principal value of one designated
currency in exchange for the other designated currency. Therefore, the entire
principal value of a currency swap is subject to the risk that the other party
to the swap will default on its contractual delivery obligations. If there is a
default by the counterparty, the Fund may have contractual remedies pursuant to
the agreements related to the transaction. The swap market has grown
substantially in recent years with a large number of banks and investment
banking firms acting both as principals and as agents utilizing standardized
swap documentation. As a result, the swap market has become relatively liquid.
Caps, floors, and collars are more recent innovations for which standardized
documentation has not yet been fully developed and, accordingly, they are less
liquid than swaps.

FUND MANAGEMENT


[PROFILES GRAPHIC OMITTED] The Fund has retained the Investment Manager --
Morgan Stanley Investment Advisors Inc. -- to provide administrative services,
manage its business affairs and invest its assets, including the placing of
orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities. The Investment Manager
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, a preeminent global financial
services firm that maintains leading market positions in each of its three
primary businesses: securities, asset management and credit services. Morgan
Stanley is a full service securities firm engaged in securities trading and
brokerage activities, as well as providing investment banking, research and

and money market instrument investments of the Fund's portfolio. Current
members of the team include Joseph J. McAlinden, Managing Director of the
Investment Manager, Ellen Gold and Leah Modigliani, Executive Directors of the
Investment Manager, and Warren Hatch, Vice President of the Investment Manager.

Fixed-Income team is responsible for implementing investment decisions with
respect to the fixed-income portion of the Fund's portfolio. Current members of
the team include W. David Armstrong and Sheila Finnerty, Managing Directors of

The Fund pays the Investment Manager a monthly management fee as full
compensation for the services and facilities furnished to the Fund, and for
Fund expenses assumed by the Investment Manager. The fee is based on the Fund's
average daily net assets. For the fiscal period February 26, 2003 (commencement
of operations) through January 31, 2004, the Fund accrued total compensation to
the Investment Manager amounting to 0.75% of the Fund's average daily net
assets.

Shareholder Information

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRICING FUND SHARES


[DOLLAR GRAPHIC OMITTED] The price of Fund shares (excluding sales charges),
called "net asset value," is based on the value of the Fund's portfolio
securities. While the assets of each Class are invested in a single portfolio of
securities, the net asset value of each Class will differ because the Classes
have different ongoing distribution fees.

The net asset value per share of the Fund is determined once daily at 4:00 p.m.
Eastern time on each day that the New York Stock Exchange is open (or, on days
when the New York Stock Exchange closes prior to 4:00 p.m., at such earlier
time). Shares will not be priced on days that the New York Stock Exchange is
closed.

The value of the Fund's portfolio securities is based on the securities' market
price when available. When a market price is not readily available, including
circumstances under which the Investment Manager determines that a security's
market price is not accurate, a portfolio security is valued at its fair value,
as determined under procedures established by the Fund's Board of Trustees. In
these cases, the Fund's net asset value will reflect certain portfolio
securities' fair value rather than their market price. With respect to
securities that are primarily listed on foreign exchanges, the value of the
Fund's portfolio securities may change on days when you will not be able to
purchase or sell your shares.


An exception to the Fund's general policy of using market prices concerns its
short-term debt portfolio securities. Debt securities with remaining maturities
of 60 days or less at the time of purchase are valued at amortized cost.
However, if the cost does not reflect the securities' market value, these
securities will be valued at their fair value.

HOW TO BUY SHARES


[HANDSHAKE GRAPHIC OMITTED] You may open a new account to buy Fund shares or buy
additional Fund shares for an existing account by contacting your Morgan Stanley
Financial Advisor or other authorized financial representative. Your Financial
Advisor will assist you, step-by-step, with the procedures to invest in the
Fund. The Fund's transfer agent, in its sole discretion, may allow you to
purchase shares directly by calling and requesting an application.

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify
and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What
this means to you: When you open an account, we will ask your name, address,
date of birth and other information that will allow us to identify you. If we
are unable to verify your identity, we reserve the right to restrict additional
transactions and/or liquidate your account at the next calculated net asset
value after your account is closed (less any applicable sales/account charges
and/or tax penalties) or take any other action required by law.

Because every investor has different immediate financial needs and long-term
investment goals, the Fund offers investors four Classes of shares: Classes A,
B, C and D. Class D shares are only offered to a limited group of investors.
Each Class of shares offers a distinct structure of sales charges, distribution
and service fees, and other features that are designed to address a variety of
needs. Your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor or other authorized financial
representative can help you decide which Class may be most appropriate for you.
When purchasing Fund shares, you must specify which Class of shares you wish to
purchase.


When you buy Fund shares, the shares are purchased at the next share price
calculated (less any applicable front-end sales charge for Class A shares)
after we receive your purchase order. Your payment is due on the third business
day after you place your purchase order. The Fund, in its sole discretion, may
waive the minimum initial and additional investment amounts in certain cases.
We reserve the right to reject any order for the purchase of Fund shares.

HOW TO EXCHANGE SHARES



[ARROWS GRAPHIC OMITTED] PERMISSIBLE FUND EXCHANGES. You may exchange shares of
any Class of the Fund for the same Class of any other continuously offered
Multi-Class Fund, or for shares of a No-Load Fund, a Money Market Fund or the
Limited Duration U.S. Treasury Trust, without the imposition of an exchange fee.
In addition, Class A shares of the Fund may be exchanged for shares of an FSC
Fund (funds subject to a front-end sales charge). See the inside back cover of
this Prospectus for each Morgan Stanley Fund's designation as a Multi-Class
Fund, a No-Load Fund, a Money Market Fund or an FSC Fund. If a Morgan Stanley
Fund is not listed, consult the inside back cover of that fund's current
prospectus for its designation.

Exchanges may be made after shares of the fund acquired by purchase have been
held for 30 days. There is no waiting period for exchanges of shares acquired
by exchange or dividend reinvestment. The current prospectus for each fund
describes its investment objective(s), policies and investment minimum, and
should be read before investment. Since exchanges are available only into
continuously offered Morgan Stanley Funds, exchanges are not available into any
new Morgan Stanley Fund during its initial offering period, or when shares of a
particular Morgan Stanley Fund are not being offered for purchase.

EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. You can process an exchange by contacting your Morgan
Stanley Financial Advisor or other authorized financial representative.
Otherwise, you must forward an exchange privilege authorization form to the
Fund's transfer agent -- Morgan Stanley Trust -- and then write the transfer
agent or call (800) 869-NEWS to place an exchange order. You can obtain an
exchange privilege authorization form by contacting your Morgan Stanley

Advisor or other authorized financial representative or by calling (800)
869-NEWS. If you hold share certificates, no exchanges may be processed until
we have received all applicable share certificates.

An exchange to any Morgan Stanley Fund (except a Money Market Fund) is made on
the basis of the next calculated net asset values of the funds involved after
the proper exchange instructions are received. When exchanging into a Money
Market Fund, the Fund's shares are sold at their next calculated net asset
value and the Money Market Fund's shares are purchased at their net asset value
on the following business day.

The Fund may terminate or revise the exchange privilege upon required written
notice. The check writing privilege is not available for Money Market Fund
shares you acquire in an exchange.

TELEPHONE EXCHANGES. For your protection when calling Morgan Stanley Trust, we
will employ reasonable procedures to confirm that exchange instructions
communicated over the telephone are genuine. These procedures may include
requiring various forms of personal identification such as name, mailing
address, social security or other tax identification number. Telephone
instructions also may be recorded.

Telephone instructions must be received by the Fund's transfer agent between
9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on any day the New York Stock Exchange is
open for business. During periods of drastic economic or market changes, it is
possible that the telephone exchange procedures may be difficult to implement,
although this has not been the case in the past.

MARGIN ACCOUNTS. If you have pledged your Fund shares in a margin account,
contact your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor or other authorized financial
representative regarding restrictions on the exchange of such shares.


TAX CONSIDERATIONS OF EXCHANGES. If you exchange shares of the Fund for shares
of another Morgan Stanley Fund, there are important tax considerations. For tax
purposes, the exchange out of the Fund is considered a sale of the Fund's
shares -- and the exchange into the other fund is considered a purchase. As a
result, you may realize a capital gain or loss.


You should review the "Tax Consequences" section and consult your own tax
professional about the tax consequences of an exchange.

LIMITATIONS ON EXCHANGES. Certain patterns of past exchanges and/or purchase or
sale transactions involving the Fund or other Morgan Stanley Funds may result
in the Fund limiting or prohibiting, at its discretion, additional purchases
and/or exchanges. Determinations in this regard may be made based on the
frequency or dollar amount of the previous exchanges or purchase or sale
transactions. You will be notified in advance of limitations on your exchange
privileges.

CDSC CALCULATIONS ON EXCHANGES. See the "Share Class Arrangements" section of
this Prospectus for a discussion of how applicable contingent deferred sales
charges (CDSCs) are calculated for shares of one Morgan Stanley Fund that are
exchanged for shares of another.

For further information regarding exchange privileges, you should contact your
Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor or call (800) 869-NEWS.

Systematic         If your investment in all of the Morgan Stanley Funds has a total market value of at least
Withdrawal Plan    $10,000, you may elect to withdraw amounts of $25 or more, or in any whole percentage of a
                   fund's balance (provided the amount is at least $25), on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or
                   annual basis, from any fund with a balance of at least $1,000. Each time you add a fund to the
                   plan, you must meet the plan requirements.

                   Amounts withdrawn are subject to any applicable CDSC. A CDSC may be waived under
                   certain circumstances. See the Class B waiver categories listed in the "Share Class
                   Arrangements" section of this Prospectus.

Withdrawal Plan    or call (800) 869-NEWS. You may terminate or suspend your plan at any time. Please
(continued)        remember that withdrawals from the plan are sales of shares, not Fund "distributions," and

PAYMENT FOR SOLD SHARES. After we receive your complete instructions to sell as
described above, a check will be mailed to you within seven days, although we
will attempt to make payment within one business day. Payment may also be sent
to your brokerage account.

Payment may be postponed or the right to sell your shares suspended under
unusual circumstances as permitted by law. If you request to sell shares that
were recently purchased by check, your sale will not be effected until it has
been verified that the check has been honored.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS. Normally, your sale of Fund shares is subject to federal
and state income tax. You should review the "Tax Consequences" section of this
Prospectus and consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of
a sale.

REINSTATEMENT PRIVILEGE. If you sell Fund shares and have not previously
exercised the reinstatement privilege, you may, within 35 days after the date
of sale, invest any portion of the proceeds in the same Class of Fund shares at
their net asset value and receive a pro rata credit for any CDSC paid in
connection with the sale.


INVOLUNTARY SALES. The Fund reserves the right, on 60 days' notice, to sell the
shares of any shareholder (other than shares held in an IRA or 403(b) Custodial
Account) whose shares, due to sales by the shareholder, have a value below
$100.

However, before the Fund sells your shares in this manner, we will notify you
and allow you 60 days to make an additional investment in an amount that will
increase the value of your account to at least the required amount before the
sale is processed. No CDSC will be imposed on any involuntary sale.

MARGIN ACCOUNTS. If you have pledged your Fund shares in a margin account,
contact your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor or other authorized financial
representative regarding restrictions on the sale of such shares.


                                                                              19

TARGETED DIVIDENDS(SM)

You may select to have your Fund distributions automatically invested in other
Classes of Fund shares or Classes of another Morgan Stanley Fund that you own.
Contact your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor for further information about
this service.
[/SIDEBAR]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISTRIBUTIONS

[CHECKBOX GRAPHIC OMITTED] The Fund passes substantially all of its earnings
from income and capital gains along to its investors as "distributions." The
Fund earns income from stocks and interest from fixed-income investments. These
amounts are passed along to Fund shareholders as "income dividend
distributions." The Fund realizes capital gains whenever it sells securities for
a higher price than it paid for them. These amounts may be passed along as
"capital gain distributions."

The Fund declares income dividends separately for each Class. Distributions
paid on Class A and Class D shares usually will be higher than for Class B and
Class C because distribution fees that Class B and Class C pay are higher.
Normally, income dividends are distributed to shareholders semi-annually.
Capital gains, if any, are usually distributed in June and December. The Fund,
however, may retain and reinvest any long-term capital gains. The Fund may at
times make payments from sources other than income or capital gains that
represent a return of a portion of your investment.


Distributions are reinvested automatically in additional shares of the same
Class and automatically credited to your account, unless you request in writing
that all distributions be paid in cash. If you elect the cash option, the Fund
will mail a check to you no later than seven business days after the
distribution is declared. However, if you purchase Fund shares through a Morgan
Stanley Financial Advisor or other authorized financial representative within
three business days prior to the record date for the distribution, the
distribution will automatically be paid to you in cash, even if you did not
request to receive all distributions in cash. No interest will accrue on
uncashed checks. If you wish to change how your distributions are paid, your
request should be received by the Fund's transfer agent, Morgan Stanley Trust,
at least five business days prior to the record date of the distributions.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAX CONSEQUENCES

[1040 GRAPHIC OMITTED] As with any investment, you should consider how your Fund
investment will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as
general information. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax
consequences of an investment in the Fund.

Unless your investment in the Fund is through a tax-deferred retirement
account, such as a 401(k) plan or IRA, you need to be aware of the possible tax
consequences when:

o    The Fund makes distributions; and

o    You sell Fund shares, including an exchange to another Morgan Stanley Fund.

TAXES ON DISTRIBUTIONS. Your distributions are normally subject to federal and
state income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest
them in Fund shares. A distribution also may be subject to local income tax.
Any income dividend distributions and any short-term capital gain distributions
are taxable to you as ordinary income. Any long-term capital


20


<PAGE>


gain distributions are taxable as long-term capital gains, no matter how long
you have owned shares in the Fund. Under recently enacted legislation, a
portion of the ordinary income dividends you receive may be taxed at the same
rate as long-term capital gains. However, even if income received in the form
of ordinary income dividends is taxed at the same rates as long-term capital
gains, such income will not be considered long-term capital gains for other
federal income tax purposes. For example, you generally will not be permitted
to offset ordinary income dividends with capital losses. Short-term capital
gain distributions will continue to be taxed at ordinary income rates.


Every January, you will be sent a statement (IRS Form 1099-DIV) showing the
taxable distributions paid to you in the previous year. The statement provides
information on your dividends and capital gains for tax purposes.

TAXES ON SALES. Your sale of Fund shares normally is subject to federal and
state income tax and may result in a taxable gain or loss to you. A sale also
may be subject to local income tax. Your exchange of Fund shares for shares of
another Morgan Stanley Fund is treated for tax purposes like a sale of your
original shares and a purchase of your new shares. Thus, the exchange may, like
a sale, result in a taxable gain or loss to you and will give you a new tax
basis for your new shares.


When you open your Fund account, you should provide your Social Security or tax
identification number on your investment application. By providing this
information, you will avoid being subject to federal backup withholding tax on
taxable distributions and redemption proceeds (as of the date of this
Prospectus this rate is 28%). Any withheld amount would be sent to the IRS as
an advance payment of your taxes due on your income for such year.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SHARE CLASS ARRANGEMENTS

[ABCD GRAPHIC OMITTED] The Fund offers several Classes of shares having
different distribution arrangements designed to provide you with different
purchase options according to your investment needs. Your Morgan Stanley
Financial Advisor or other authorized financial representative can help you
decide which Class may be appropriate for you.

The general public is offered three Classes: Class A shares, Class B shares and
Class C shares, which differ principally in terms of sales charges and ongoing
expenses. A fourth Class, Class D shares, is offered only to a limited category
of investors. Shares that you acquire through reinvested distributions will not
be subject to any front-end sales charge or CDSC -- contingent deferred sales
charge.

Sales personnel may receive different compensation for selling each Class of
shares. The sales charges applicable to each Class provide for the distribution
financing of shares of that Class.

The chart below compares the sales charge and the annual 12b-1 fees applicable
to each Class:

CLASS A SHARES Class A shares are sold at net asset value plus an initial sales
charge of up to 5.25%. The initial sales charge is reduced for purchases of
$25,000 or more according to the schedule below. Investments of $1 million or
more are not subject to an initial sales charge, but are generally subject to a
contingent deferred sales charge, or CDSC, of 1.0% on sales made within one year
after the last day of the month of purchase. The CDSC will be assessed in the
same manner and with the same CDSC waivers as with Class B shares. Class A
shares are also subject to a distribution (12b-1) fee of up to 0.25% of the
average daily net assets of the Class. This fee is lower than the distribution
fee paid by Class B or Class C.


The Fund will not accept a purchase order for Class A shares that qualifies for
investment in Class D shares.

The reduced sales charge schedule is applicable to purchases of Class A shares
in a single transaction by:

o    A single account (including an individual, trust or fiduciary account).

o    Family member accounts (limited to husband, wife and children under the age
     of 21).

o    Pension, profit sharing or other employee benefit plans of companies and
     their affiliates.

o    Tax-exempt organizations.

o    Groups organized for a purpose other than to buy mutual fund shares.

COMBINED PURCHASE PRIVILEGE. You also will have the benefit of reduced sales
charges by combining purchases of Class A shares of the Fund in a single
transaction with purchases of Class A shares of other Multi-Class Funds and
shares of FSC Funds.


RIGHT OF ACCUMULATION. You also may benefit from a reduction of sales charges,
if the cumulative net asset value of Class A shares of the Fund purchased in a
single transaction, together with shares of other Morgan Stanley Funds you
currently own which were previously purchased at a price including a front-end
sales charge (or Class A shares purchased at $1 million



22


<PAGE>


or more), and shares acquired through reinvestment of distributions), amounts
to $25,000 or more. Also, if you have a cumulative net asset value of all your
Class A and Class D shares equal to at least $5 million (or $25 million for
certain employee benefit plans), you are eligible to purchase Class D shares of
any fund subject to the fund's minimum initial investment requirement.

You must notify your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor or other authorized
financial representative (or Morgan Stanley Trust if you purchase directly
through the Fund) at the time a purchase order is placed, that the purchase
qualifies for the reduced sales charge under the Right of Accumulation. Similar
notification must be made in writing when an order is placed by mail. The
reduced sales charge will not be granted if: (i) notification is not furnished
at the time of the order; or (ii) a review of the records of Morgan Stanley DW
Inc. ("Morgan Stanley DW") or other authorized dealer of Fund shares or the
Fund's transfer agent does not confirm your represented holdings.


LETTER OF INTENT. The schedule of reduced sales charges for larger purchases
also will be available to you if you enter into a written "Letter of Intent." A
Letter of Intent provides for the purchase of Class A shares of the Fund or
other Multi-Class Funds or shares of FSC Funds within a 13-month period. The
initial purchase under a Letter of Intent must be at least 5% of the stated
investment goal. To determine the applicable sales charge reduction, you may
also include: (1) the cost of shares of other Morgan Stanley Funds which were
previously purchased at a price including a front-end sales charge during the
90-day period prior to the distributor receiving the Letter of Intent, and (2)
the cost of shares of other funds you currently own acquired in exchange for
shares of funds purchased during that period at a price including a front-end
sales charge. You can obtain a Letter of Intent by contacting your Morgan
Stanley Financial Advisor or other authorized financial representative, or by
calling (800) 869-NEWS. If you do not achieve the stated investment goal within
the 13-month period, you are required to pay the difference between the sales
charges otherwise applicable and sales charges actually paid, which may be
deducted from your investment.


OTHER SALES CHARGE WAIVERS. In addition to investments of $1 million or more,
your purchase of Class A shares is not subject to a front-end sales charge (or
a CDSC upon sale) if your account qualifies under one of the following
categories:

o    A trust for which Morgan Stanley Trust provides discretionary trustee
     services.

o    Persons participating in a fee-based investment program (subject to all of
     its terms and conditions, including termination fees, and mandatory sale or
     transfer restrictions on termination) approved by the Fund's distributor
     pursuant to which they pay an asset based fee for investment advisory,
     administrative and/or brokerage services.

o    Donor-advised charitable gift funds (subject to all applicable terms and
     conditions) and certain other investment programs that do not charge an
     asset-based fee and have been approved by the Fund's distributor.

o    Employer-sponsored employee benefit plans, whether or not qualified under
     the Internal Revenue Code, for which (i) Morgan Stanley Trust serves as
     trustee, (ii) Morgan Stanley's Retirement Plan Services serves as
     recordkeeper under a written Recordkeeping Services Agreement or (iii) an
     entity independent from Morgan Stanley serves as recordkeeper under an
     alliance or similar agreement with Morgan Stanley's Retirement Plan
     Services (together, "Morgan Stanley Eligible Plans"), provided that in the
     case of (i) and (ii) above, any such plan has at least 200 eligible
     employees.


                                                                              23


<PAGE>

o    A Morgan Stanley Eligible Plan whose Class B shares have converted to Class
     A shares, regardless of the plan's asset size or number of eligible
     employees.

o    Insurance company separate accounts that have been approved by the Fund's
     distributor.

o    A client of a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor who joined us from another
     investment firm within six months prior to the date of purchase of Fund
     shares, and who used the proceeds from the sale of shares of a proprietary
     mutual fund of that Financial Advisor's previous firm that imposed either a
     front-end or deferred sales charge to purchase Class A shares, provided
     that: (1) the client sold the shares not more than 60 days prior to the
     purchase of Fund shares, and (2) the sale proceeds were maintained in the
     interim in cash or a Money Market Fund.

o    Current or retired Directors or Trustees of the Morgan Stanley Funds, such
     persons' spouses and children under the age of 21, and trust accounts for
     which any of such persons is a beneficiary.

o    Current or retired directors, officers and employees of Morgan Stanley and
     any of its subsidiaries, such persons' spouses and children under the age
     of 21, and trust accounts for which any of such persons is a beneficiary.



CLASS B SHARES Class B shares are offered at net asset value with no initial
sales charge but are subject to a contingent deferred sales charge, or CDSC, as
set forth in the table below. For the purpose of calculating the CDSC, shares
are deemed to have been purchased on the last day of the month during which they
were purchased.

Each time you place an order to sell or exchange shares, shares with no CDSC
will be sold or exchanged first, then shares with the lowest CDSC will be sold
or exchanged next. For any shares subject to a CDSC, the CDSC will be assessed
on an amount equal to the lesser of the current market value or the cost of the
shares being sold.

The Fund will generally not accept a purchase order for Class B shares in the
amount of $100,000 or more.

CDSC WAIVERS. A CDSC, if otherwise applicable, will be waived in the case of:

o    Sales of shares held at the time you die or become disabled (within the
     definition in Section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code which relates
     to the ability to engage in gainful employment), if the shares are: (i)
     registered either in your name (not a trust) or in the names of you and
     your spouse as joint tenants with right of survivorship; or (ii) held in a
     qualified corporate or self-employed retirement plan, IRA or 403(b)
     Custodial Account, provided in either case that the sale is requested
     within one year of your death or initial determination of disability.

o    Sales in connection with the following retirement plan "distributions": (i)
     lump-sum or other distributions from a qualified corporate or self-employed
     retirement plan following retirement (or, in the case of a "key employee"
     of a "top heavy" plan, following attainment of age 591/2); (ii)
     distributions from an IRA or 403(b) Custodial Account following attainment
     of age 591/2; or (iii) a tax-free return of an excess IRA contribution (a
     "distribution" does not include a direct transfer of IRA, 403(b) Custodial
     Account or retirement plan assets to a successor custodian or trustee).

o    Sales of shares held for you as a participant in a Morgan Stanley Eligible
     Plan.

o    Sales of shares in connection with the Systematic Withdrawal Plan of up to
     12% annually of the value of each fund from which plan sales are made. The
     percentage is determined on the date you establish the Systematic
     Withdrawal Plan and based on the next calculated share price. You may have
     this CDSC waiver applied in amounts up to 1% per month, 3% per quarter, 6%
     semi-annually or 12% annually. Shares with no CDSC will be sold first,
     followed by those with the lowest CDSC. As such, the waiver benefit will be
     reduced by the amount of your shares that are not subject to a CDSC. If you
     suspend your participation in the plan, you may later resume plan payments
     without requiring a new determination of the account value for the 12% CDSC
     waiver.


o    Sales of shares purchased prior to April 1, 2004 or acquired in exchange
     for shares purchased prior to April 1, 2004, if you simultaneously invest
     the proceeds from such sale in the Investment Manager's mutual fund asset
     allocation program, pursuant to which investors pay an asset-based fee. Any
     shares acquired in connection with the Investment Manager's mutual fund
     asset allocation program are subject to all of the terms and conditions of
     that program, including termination fees, and mandatory sale or transfer
     restrictions on termination.

All waivers will be granted only following the Fund's distributor receiving
confirmation of your entitlement. If you believe you are eligible for a CDSC
waiver, please contact your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor or other
authorized financial representative or call (800) 869-NEWS.


DISTRIBUTION FEE. Class B shares are subject to an annual distribution (12b-1)
fee of 1.0% of the average daily net assets of Class B. This fee is higher than
the distribution fee paid by Class A.


CONVERSION FEATURE. After 10 years, Class B shares will convert automatically
to Class A shares of the Fund with no initial sales charge. The ten year period
runs from the last day of the month in which the shares were purchased, or in
the case of Class B shares acquired through an exchange, from the last day of
the month in which the original Class B shares were purchased; the shares will
convert to Class A shares based on their relative net asset values in the month
following the ten year period. At the same time, an equal proportion of Class B
shares



                                                                              25


<PAGE>

acquired through automatically reinvested distributions will convert to Class A
shares on the same basis. (Class B shares acquired in exchange for shares of
another Morgan Stanley Fund originally purchased before May 1, 1997, however,
will convert to Class A shares in May, 2007).

In the case of Class B shares held in a Morgan Stanley Eligible Plan, the plan
is treated as a single investor and all Class B shares will convert to Class A
shares on the conversion date of the Class B shares of a Morgan Stanley Fund
purchased by that plan.

Currently, the Class B share conversion is not a taxable event; the conversion
feature may be cancelled if it is deemed a taxable event in the future by the
Internal Revenue Service.


If you exchange your Class B shares for shares of a Money Market Fund, a
No-Load Fund or the Limited Duration U.S. Treasury Trust, the holding period
for conversion is frozen as of the last day of the month of the exchange and
resumes on the last day of the month you exchange back into Class B shares.


EXCHANGING SHARES SUBJECT TO A CDSC. There are special considerations when you
exchange Fund shares that are subject to a CDSC. When determining the length of
time you held the shares and the corresponding CDSC rate, any period (starting
at the end of the month) during which you held shares of a fund that does not
charge a CDSC will not be counted. Thus, in effect the "holding period" for
purposes of calculating the CDSC is frozen upon exchanging into a fund that
does not charge a CDSC.

For example, if you held Class B shares of the Fund for one year, exchanged to
Class B of another Morgan Stanley Multi-Class Fund for another year, then sold
your shares, a CDSC rate of 4% would be imposed on the shares based on a two
year holding period -- one year for each fund. However, if you had exchanged
the shares of the Fund for a Money Market Fund (which does not charge a CDSC)
instead of the Multi-Class Fund, then sold your shares, a CDSC rate of 5% would
be imposed on the shares based on a one year holding period. The one year in
the Money Market Fund would not be counted. Nevertheless, if shares subject to
a CDSC are exchanged for a fund that does not charge a CDSC, you will receive a
credit when you sell the shares equal to the distribution (12b-1) fees you paid
on those shares while in that fund up to the amount of any applicable CDSC.

In addition, shares that are exchanged into or from a Morgan Stanley Fund
subject to a higher CDSC rate will be subject to the higher rate, even if the
shares are re-exchanged into a fund with a lower CDSC rate.


CLASS C SHARES Class C shares are sold at net asset value with no initial sales
charge, but are subject to a CDSC of 1.0% on sales made within one year after
the last day of the month of purchase. The CDSC will be assessed in the same
manner and with the same CDSC waivers as with Class B shares. The Fund will not
accept a purchase order for Class C shares in the amount of $1 million or more.


DISTRIBUTION FEE. Class C shares are subject to an annual distribution (12b-1)
fee of up to 1.0% of the average daily net assets of that Class. This fee is
higher than the annual distribution fee paid by Class A. Unlike Class B shares,
Class C shares have no conversion feature and, accordingly, an investor that
purchases Class C shares may be subject to distribution (12b-1) fees applicable
to Class C shares for an indefinite period.


26


<PAGE>
CLASS D SHARES Class D shares are offered without any sales charge on purchases
or sales and without any distribution (12b-1) fee. Class D shares are offered
only to investors meeting an initial investment minimum of $5 million ($25
million for Morgan Stanley Eligible Plans) and the following categories of
investors:

o    Investors participating in the Investment Manager's mutual fund asset
     allocation program (subject to all of its terms and conditions, including
     termination fees, and mandatory sale or transfer restrictions on
     termination) pursuant to which they pay an asset-based fee.

o    Persons participating in a fee-based investment program (subject to all of
     its terms and conditions, including termination fees, and mandatory sale or
     transfer restrictions on termination) approved by the Fund's distributor
     pursuant to which they pay an asset based fee for investment advisory,
     administrative and/or brokerage services. With respect to Class D shares
     held through the Morgan Stanley Choice Program, at such time as those Fund
     shares are no longer held through the program, the shares will be
     automatically converted into Class A shares (which are subject to higher
     expenses than Class D shares) based on the then current relative net asset
     values of the two Classes.

o    Certain investment programs that do not charge an asset-based fee and have
     been approved by the Fund's distributor.

o    Employee benefit plans maintained by Morgan Stanley or any of its
     subsidiaries for the benefit of certain employees of Morgan Stanley and its
     subsidiaries.

o    Certain unit investment trusts sponsored by Morgan Stanley DW or its
     affiliates.

o    Certain other open-end investment companies whose shares are distributed by
     the Fund's distributor.

o    Investors who were shareholders of the Dean Witter Retirement Series on
     September 11, 1998 for additional purchases for their former Dean Witter
     Retirement Series accounts.

A purchase order that meets the requirements for investment in Class D can be
made only in Class D shares.

Class D shares are not offered for investments made through donor-advised
charitable gift funds and insurance company separate accounts that have been
approved by the Fund's distributor (regardless of the size of the investment).

MEETING CLASS D ELIGIBILITY MINIMUMS. To meet the $5 million ($25 million for
Morgan Stanley Eligible Plans) initial investment to qualify to purchase Class
D shares you may combine: (1) purchases in a single transaction of Class D
shares of the Fund and other Morgan Stanley Multi-Class Funds; and/or (2)
previous purchases of Class A and Class D shares of Multi-Class Funds and
shares of FSC Funds you currently own, along with shares of Morgan Stanley
Funds you currently own that you acquired in exchange for those shares.

NO SALES CHARGES FOR REINVESTED CASH DISTRIBUTIONS If you receive a cash payment
representing an income dividend or capital gain and you reinvest that amount in
the applicable Class of shares by returning the check within 30 days of the
payment date, the purchased shares would not be subject to an initial sales
charge or CDSC.

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (RULE 12B-1 FEES) The Fund has adopted a Plan of
Distribution in accordance with Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of
1940 with respect to the distribution of Class A, Class B and Class C shares.
(Class D shares are offered without any distribution fee.) The Plan allows the
Fund to pay


                                                                              27


<PAGE>


distribution fees for the sale and distribution of these shares. It also allows
the Fund to pay for services to shareholders of Class A, Class B and Class C
shares. Because these fees are paid out of the Fund's assets on an ongoing
basis, over time these fees will increase the cost of your investment in these
Classes and may cost you more than paying other types of sales charges.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION The Investment Advisor and/or the Distributor may pay
additional compensation (out of their own funds and not as an expense of the
Fund) to selected affiliated or unaffiliated brokers or other service providers
in connection with the sale, distribution, retention and/or servicing of shares
of the Fund shares. Such compensation may be significant in amount and the
prospect of receiving any such additional compensation may provide affiliated or
unaffiliated entities with incentive to favor sales of the Fund over other
investment options. Any such payments will not change the net asset value or the
price of the Fund's shares. For more information, please see the Fund's
Statement of Additional Information.

I. FUND HISTORY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Fund was organized as a Massachusetts business trust, under a
Declaration of Trust, on October 25, 2002, with the name Morgan Stanley
Allocator Fund.


II. DESCRIPTION OF THE FUND AND ITS INVESTMENTS AND RISKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.   CLASSIFICATION


     The Fund is an open-end, non-diversified management investment company
whose investment objective is to seek to maximize total investment return over
different stages of an economic cycle. The Fund intends to comply with the
diversification requirements applicable to regulated investment companies under
federal tax law.


B.   INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND RISKS

     The following discussion of the Fund's investment strategies (certain of
which relate to the Fund's principal investment strategies) and risks should be
read with the sections of the Fund's Prospectus titled "Principal Investment
Strategies," "Principal Risks," "Additional Investment Strategy Information"
and "Additional Risk Information."


     CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES. The Fund may invest in securities which are
convertible into common stock or other securities of the same or a different
issuer or into cash within a particular period of time at a specific price or
formula. Convertible securities are generally fixed-income securities (but may
include preferred stock) and generally rank senior to common stocks in a
corporation's capital structure and, therefore, entail less risk than the
corporation's common stock. The value of a convertible security is a function
of its "investment value" (its value as if it did not have a conversion
privilege), and its "conversion value" (the security's worth if it were to be
exchanged for the underlying security, at market value, pursuant to its
conversion privilege).


     To the extent that a convertible security's investment value is greater
than its conversion value, its price will be primarily a reflection of such
investment value and its price will be likely to increase when interest rates
fall and decrease when interest rates rise, as with a fixed-income security
(the credit standing of the issuer and other factors may also have an effect on
the convertible security's value). If the conversion value exceeds the
investment value, the price of the convertible security will rise above its
investment value and, in addition, will sell at some premium over its
conversion value. (This premium represents the price investors are willing to
pay for the privilege of purchasing a fixed-income security with a possibility
of capital appreciation due to the conversion privilege.) At such times the
price of the convertible security will tend to fluctuate directly with the
price of the underlying equity security. Convertible securities may be
purchased by the Fund at varying price levels above their investment values
and/or their conversion values in keeping with the Fund's objective.


     Up to 5% of the Fund's net assets may be invested in convertible
securities that are below investment grade. Debt securities rated below
investment grade are commonly known as "junk bonds." Although the Fund selects
these securities primarily on the basis of their equity characteristic,
investors should be aware that convertible securities rated in these categories
are considered high risk securities; the rating agencies consider them
speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to make timely
payments of interest and principal. Thus, to the extent that such convertible
securities are acquired by the Fund, there is a greater risk as to the timely
repayment of the principal of, and timely payment of interest or dividends on,
such securities than in the case of higher-rated convertible securities.

     OPTION AND FUTURES TRANSACTIONS. The Fund may engage in transactions in
listed and Over the Counter ("OTC") options with respect to equities, debt
securities and stock and bond indices. Listed options are issued or guaranteed
by the exchange on which they are traded or by a clearing corporation such as
the Options Clearing Corporation ("OCC"). Ownership of a listed call option
gives the Fund the right to buy from the OCC (in the United States) or other
clearing corporation or exchange, the underlying security or currency covered
by the option at the stated exercise price (the price per unit of the
underlying



                                       4


<PAGE>


security) by filing an exercise notice prior to the expiration date of the
option. The writer (seller) of the option would then have the obligation to
sell to the OCC (in the United States) or other clearing corporation or
exchange, the underlying security or currency at that exercise price prior to
the expiration date of the option, regardless of its then current market price.
Ownership of a listed put option would give the Fund the right to sell the
underlying security or currency to the OCC (in the United States) or other
clearing corporation or exchange, at the stated exercise price. Upon notice of
exercise of the put option, the writer of the put would have the obligation to
purchase the underlying security or currency from the OCC (in the United
States) or other clearing corporation or exchange, at the exercise price.


     Covered Call Writing. The Fund is permitted to write covered call options
on portfolio securities and on the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in which
they are denominated, without limit.

     The Fund will receive from the purchaser, in return for a call it has
written, a "premium": i.e., the price of the option. Receipt of these premiums
may better enable the Fund to earn a higher level of current income than it
would earn from holding the underlying securities or currency alone. Moreover,
the premium received will offset a portion of the potential loss incurred by
the Fund if the securities or currencies underlying the option decline in
value.


     The Fund may be required, at any time during the option period, to deliver
the underlying security or currency against payment of the exercise price on
any calls it has written. This obligation is terminated upon the expiration of
the option period or at such earlier time as the writer effects a closing
purchase transaction. A closing purchase transaction is accomplished by
purchasing an option of the same series as the option previously written.
However, once the Fund has been assigned an exercise notice, the Fund will be
unable to effect a closing purchase transaction.


     A call option is "covered" if the Fund owns the underlying security
subject to the option or has an absolute and immediate right to acquire that
security without additional cash consideration (or for additional consideration
(in cash, Treasury bills or other liquid portfolio securities) held in a
segregated account on the Fund's books) upon conversion or exchange of other
securities held in its portfolio. A call option is also covered if the Fund
holds a call on the same security as the call written where the exercise price
of the call held is (i) equal to or less than the exercise price of the call
written or (ii) greater than the exercise price of the call written if the
difference is maintained by the Fund in cash, Treasury bills or other liquid
portfolio securities in a segregated account on the Fund's books.


     Options written by the Fund normally have expiration dates of up to 18
months from the date written. The exercise price of a call option may be below,
equal to or above the current market value of the underlying security at the
time the option is written.


     Covered Put Writing. A writer of a covered put option incurs an obligation
to buy the security underlying the option from the purchaser of the put, at the
option's exercise price at any time during the option period, at the
purchaser's election. Through the writing of a put option, the Fund would
receive income from the premium paid by purchasers. The potential gain on a
covered put option is limited to the premium received on the option (less the
commissions paid on the transaction). During the option period, the Fund may be
required to make payment of the exercise price against delivery of the
underlying security. A put option is "covered" if the Fund maintains cash,
Treasury bills or other liquid portfolio securities with a value equal to the
exercise price in a segregated account on the Fund's books, or holds a put on
the same security as the put written where the exercise price of the put held
is equal to or greater than the exercise price of the put written. The
operation of and limitations on covered put options in other respects are
substantially identical to those of call options.

     Purchasing Call and Put Options. The Fund may purchase listed and OTC call
and put options in amounts equaling up to 5% of its total assets. The purchase
of a call option would enable the Fund, in return for the premium paid, to lock
in a purchase price for a security or currency during the term of the option.
The purchase of a put option would enable the Fund, in return for a premium
paid, to lock in a price at which it may sell a security or currency during the
term of the option.

     Options on Foreign Currencies. The Fund may purchase and write options on
foreign currencies for purposes similar to those involved with investing in
forward foreign currency exchange contracts.

     OTC Options. OTC options are purchased from or sold (written) to dealers
or financial institutions which have entered into direct agreements with the
Fund. With OTC options, such variables as expiration


                                       5


<PAGE>

date, exercise price and premium will be agreed upon between the Fund and the
transacting dealer, without the intermediation of a third party such as the
OCC. The Fund may engage in OTC option transactions only with member banks of
the Federal Reserve Bank System or primary dealers in U.S. Government
securities or with affiliates of such banks or dealers. Certain OTC options are
considered to be illiquid investments.

     Risks of Options Transactions. The successful use of options depends on
the ability of the Investment Manager, to forecast correctly interest rates,
currency exchange rates and/or market movements. If the market value of the
portfolio securities upon which call options have been written increases, the
Fund may receive a lower total return from the portion of its portfolio upon
which calls have been written than it would have had such calls not been
written. During the option period, the covered call writer has, in return for
the premium on the option, given up the opportunity for capital appreciation
above the exercise price should the market price of the underlying security (or
the value of its denominated currency) increase, but has retained the risk of
loss should the price of the underlying security decline. The covered put
writer also retains the risk of loss should the market value of the underlying
security decline (or the value of its denominated currency) below the exercise
price of the option less the premium received on the sale of the option. In
both cases, the writer has no control over the time when it may be required to
fulfill its obligation as a writer of the option. Prior to exercise or
expiration, an option position can only be terminated by entering into a
closing purchase or sale transaction. Once an option writer has received an
exercise notice, it cannot effect a closing purchase transaction in order to
terminate its obligation under the option and must deliver or receive the
underlying securities at the exercise price.

     The Fund's ability to close out its position as a writer of an option is
dependent upon the existence of a liquid secondary market on option exchanges.
There is no assurance that such a market will exist, particularly in the case
of OTC options.

     In the event of the bankruptcy of a broker through which the Fund engages
in transactions in options, the Fund could experience delays and/or losses in
liquidating open positions purchased or sold through the broker and/or incur a
loss of all or part of its margin deposits with the broker. In the case of OTC
options, if the transacting dealer fails to make or take delivery of the
securities underlying an option it has written, in accordance with the terms of
that option, due to insolvency or otherwise, the Fund would lose the premium
paid for the option as well as any anticipated benefit of the transaction.

     Each of the exchanges has established limitations governing the maximum
number of call or put options on the same underlying security which may be
written by a single investor, whether acting alone or in concert with others
(regardless of whether such options are written on the same or different
exchanges or are held or written on one or more accounts or through one or more
brokers). An exchange may order the liquidation of positions found to be in
violation of these limits and it may impose other sanctions or restrictions.
These position limits may restrict the number of listed options which the Fund
may write.

     The hours of trading for options may not conform to the hours during which
the underlying securities are traded. To the extent that the option markets
close before the markets for the underlying securities, significant price and
rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be
reflected in the option markets.

     The markets in foreign currency options are relatively new and the Fund's
ability to establish and close out positions on such options is subject to the
maintenance of a liquid secondary market. There can be no assurance that a
liquid secondary market will exist for a particular option at any specific
time.

     The value of a foreign currency option depends upon the value of the
underlying currency relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result, the price of the
option position may vary with changes in the value of either or both currencies
and have no relationship to the investment merits of a foreign security.
Because foreign currency transactions occurring in the interbank market involve
substantially larger amounts than those that may be involved in the use of
foreign currency options, investors may be disadvantaged by having to deal in
an odd lot market (generally consisting of transactions of less than $1
million) for the underlying foreign currencies at prices that are less
favorable than for round lots.


                                       6


<PAGE>

     There is no systematic reporting of last sale information for foreign
currencies or any regulatory requirement that quotations available through
dealers or other market sources be firm or revised on a timely basis. Quotation
information available is generally representative of very large transactions in
the interbank market and thus may not reflect relatively smaller transactions
(i.e., less than $1 million) where rates may be less favorable. The interbank
market in foreign currencies is a global, around-the-clock market. To the
extent that the U.S. options markets are closed while the markets for the
underlying currencies remain open, significant price and rate movements may
take place in the underlying markets that are not reflected in the options
market.

     Stock Index Options. The Fund may invest in options on broadly based
indexes. Options on stock indexes are similar to options on stock except that,
rather than the right to take or make delivery of stock at a specified price,
an option on a stock index gives the holder the right to receive, upon exercise
of the option, an amount of cash if the closing level of the stock index upon
which the option is based is greater than, in the case of a call, or less than,
in the case of a put, the exercise price of the option. This amount of cash is
equal to such difference between the closing price of the index and the
exercise price of the option expressed in dollars times a specified multiple.
The writer of the option is obligated, in return for the premium received, to
make delivery of this amount.

     Risks of Options on Indexes. Because exercises of stock index options are
settled in cash, the Fund could not, if it wrote a call option, provide in
advance for its potential settlement obligations by acquiring and holding the
underlying securities. A call writer can offset some of the risk of its writing
position by holding a diversified portfolio of stocks similar to those on which
the underlying index is based. However, most investors cannot, as a practical
matter, acquire and hold a portfolio containing exactly the same stocks as the
underlying index, and, as a result, bear a risk that the value of the
securities held will vary from the value of the index. Even if an index call
writer could assemble a stock portfolio that exactly reproduced the composition
of the underlying index, the writer still would not be fully covered from a
risk standpoint because of the "timing risk" inherent in writing index options.

     When an index option is exercised, the amount of cash that the holder is
entitled to receive is determined by the difference between the exercise price
and the closing index level on the date when the option is exercised. As with
other kinds of options, the writer will not learn that it had been assigned
until the next business day, at the earliest. The time lag between exercise and
notice of assignment poses no risk for the writer of a covered call on a
specific underlying security, such as a common stock, because there the
writer's obligation is to deliver the underlying security, not to pay its value
as of a fixed time in the past. So long as the writer already owns the
underlying security, it can satisfy its settlement obligations by simply
delivering it, and the risk that its value may have declined since the exercise
date is borne by the exercising holder. In contrast, even if the writer of an
index call holds stock that exactly match the composition of the underlying
index, it will not be able to satisfy its assignment obligations by delivering
those stocks against payment of the exercise price. Instead, it will be
required to pay cash in an amount based on the closing index value on the
exercise date; and by the time it learns that it has been assigned, the index
may have declined, with a corresponding decrease in the value of its stock
portfolio. This "timing risk" is an inherent limitation on the ability of index
call writers to cover their risk exposure by holding stock positions.

     A holder of an index option who exercises it before the closing index
value for that day is available runs the risk that the level of the underlying
index may subsequently change. If a change causes the exercised option to fall
out-of-the-money, the exercising holder will be required to pay the difference
between the closing index value and the exercise price of the option (times the
applicable multiplier) to the assigned writer.

     If dissemination of the current level of an underlying index is
interrupted, or if trading is interrupted in stocks accounting for a
substantial portion of the value of an index, the trading of options on that
index will ordinarily be halted. If the trading of options on an underlying
index is halted, an exchange may impose restrictions prohibiting the exercise
of such options.

     ALL OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS. When required by law, the Fund will cause its
custodian bank to earmark cash, U.S. government securities or other appropriate
liquid portfolio securities in an amount equal to the value of the Fund's total
assets committed to the consummation of options contracts entered


                                       7


<PAGE>

into under the circumstances set forth above. If the value of such securities
so earmarked declines, additional cash or securities will be earmarked on a
daily basis so that the value of such securities will equal the amount of the
Fund's commitments with respect to such contracts.

     Futures Contracts. The Fund may purchase and sell interest rate, currency
and index futures contracts that are traded on U.S. and foreign commodity
exchanges on such underlying securities as U.S. Treasury bonds, notes, bills,
GNMA Certificates and/or on any foreign government fixed-income security, on
various currencies and on such indexes of U.S. and foreign securities as may
exist or come into existence.

     A futures contract purchaser incurs an obligation to take delivery of a
specified amount of the obligation underlying the contract at a specified time
in the future for a specified price. A seller of a futures contract incurs an
obligation to deliver the specified amount of the underlying obligation at a
specified time in return for an agreed upon price. The purchase of a futures
contract enables the Fund, during the term of the contract, to lock in a price
at which it may purchase a security or currency and protect against a rise in
prices pending purchase of portfolio securities. The sale of a futures contract
enables the Fund to lock in a price at which it may sell a security or currency
and protect against declines in the value of portfolio securities.

     Although most futures contracts call for actual delivery or acceptance of
securities, the contracts usually are closed out before the settlement date
without the making or taking of delivery. Index futures contracts provide for
the delivery of an amount of cash equal to a specified dollar amount times the
difference between the index value at the open or close of the last trading day
of the contract and the futures contract price. A futures contract sale is
closed out by effecting a futures contract purchase for the same aggregate
amount of the specific type of security (currency) and the same delivery date.
If the sale price exceeds the offsetting purchase price, the seller would be
paid the difference and would realize a gain. If the offsetting purchase price
exceeds the sale price, the seller would pay the difference and would realize a
loss. Similarly, a futures contract purchase is closed out by effecting a
futures contract sale for the same aggregate amount of the specific type of
security (currency) and the same delivery date. If the offsetting sale price
exceeds the purchase price, the purchaser would realize a gain, whereas if the
purchase price exceeds the offsetting sale price, the purchaser would realize a
loss. There is no assurance that the Fund will be able to enter into a closing
transaction.

     Margin. If the Fund enters into a futures contract, it is initially
required to deposit an "initial margin" of cash, U.S. government securities or
other liquid portfolio securities ranging from approximately 2% to 5% of the
contract amount. Initial margin requirements are established by the exchanges
on which futures contracts trade and may, from time to time, change. In
addition, brokers may establish margin deposit requirements in excess of those
required by the exchanges.


     Initial margin in futures transactions is different from margin in
securities transactions in that initial margin does not involve the borrowing
of funds by a broker's client but is, rather, a good faith deposit on the
futures contract which will be returned to the Fund upon the proper termination
of the futures contract. The margin deposits made are marked-to-market daily
and the Fund may be required to make subsequent deposits of cash, U.S.
government securities or other liquid portfolio securities, called "variation
margin," which are reflective of price fluctuations in the futures contract.

     Options on Futures Contracts. The Fund may purchase and write call and put
options on futures contracts and enter into closing transactions with respect
to such options to terminate an existing position. An option on a futures
contract gives the purchaser the right (in return for the premium paid), and
the writer the obligation, to assume a position in a futures contract (a long
position if the option is a call and a short position if the option is a put)
at a specified exercise price at any time during the term of the option. Upon
exercise of the option, the delivery of the futures position by the writer of
the option to the holder of the option is accompanied by delivery of the
accumulated balance in the writer's futures margin account, which represents
the amount by which the market price of the futures contract at the time of
exercise exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put)
the exercise price of the option on the futures contract.



                                       8


<PAGE>

     The writer of an option on a futures contract is required to deposit
initial and variation margin pursuant to requirements similar to those
applicable to futures contracts. Premiums received from the writing of an
option on a futures contract are included in initial margin deposits.


     Limitations on Futures Contracts and Options on Futures. The Commodity
Futures Trading Commission recently eliminated limitations on futures trading
by certain regulated entities, including registered investment companies and
consequently registered investment companies may engage in unlimited futures
transactions and options thereon provided that the investment manager to the
company claims an exclusion from regulation as a commodity pool operator. In
connection with its management of the Fund, the Investment Manager has claimed
such an exclusion from registration as a commodity pool operator under the
Commodity Exchange Act ("CEA") and, therefore, is not subject to the
registration and regulatory requirements of the CEA. Therefore there are no
limitations on the extent to which the Fund may engage in non-hedging
transactions involving futures and options thereon except as set forth in the
Fund's Prospectus or Statement of Additional Information. There is no overall
limitation on the percentage of the Fund's net assets which may be subject to a
hedge position.


     Risks of Transactions in Futures Contracts and Related Options. The prices
of securities and indexes subject to futures contracts (and thereby the futures
contract prices) may correlate imperfectly with the behavior of the cash prices
of the Fund's securities (and the currencies in which they are denominated).
Also, prices of futures contracts may not move in tandem with the changes in
prevailing interest rates, market movements and/or currency exchange rates
against which the Fund seeks a hedge. A correlation may also be distorted (a)
temporarily, by short-term traders seeking to profit from the difference
between a contract or security price objective and their cost of borrowed
funds; (b) by investors in futures contracts electing to close out their
contracts through offsetting transactions rather than meet margin deposit
requirements; (c) by investors in futures contracts opting to make or take
delivery of underlying securities rather than engage in closing transactions,
thereby reducing liquidity of the futures market; and (d) temporarily, by
speculators who view the deposit requirements in the futures markets as less
onerous than margin requirements in the cash market. Due to the possibility of
price distortion in the futures market and because of the possible imperfect
correlation between movements in the prices of securities and movements in the
prices of futures contracts, a correct forecast of interest rate, currency
exchange rate and/or market movement trends by the Investment Manager may still
not result in a successful hedging transaction.

     There is no assurance that a liquid secondary market will exist for
futures contracts and related options in which the Fund may invest. In the
event a liquid market does not exist, it may not be possible to close out a
futures position and, in the event of adverse price movements, the Fund would
continue to be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin. The
absence of a liquid market in futures contracts might cause the Fund to make or
take delivery of the underlying securities (currencies) at a time when it may
be disadvantageous to do so.


     Exchanges also limit the amount by which the price of a futures contract
may move on any day. If the price moves equal to the daily limit on successive
days, then it may prove impossible to liquidate a futures position until the
daily limit moves have ceased. In the event of adverse price movements, the
Fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments of variation
margin on open futures positions. In these situations, if the Fund has
insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio securities to meet daily
variation margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do
so. In addition, the Fund may be required to take or make delivery of the
instruments underlying interest rate futures contracts it holds at a time when
it is disadvantageous to do so. The inability to close out options and futures
positions could also have an adverse impact on the Fund's ability to
effectively hedge its portfolio.


     Futures contracts and options thereon which are purchased or sold on
foreign commodities exchanges may have greater price volatility than their U.S.
counterparts. Furthermore, foreign commodities exchanges may be less regulated
and under less governmental scrutiny than U.S. exchanges. Brokerage
commissions, clearing costs and other transaction costs may be higher on
foreign exchanges. Greater margin requirements may limit the Fund's ability to
enter into certain commodity transactions on foreign exchanges. Moreover,
differences in clearance and delivery requirements on foreign exchanges may
occasion delays in the settlement of the Fund's transactions effected on
foreign exchanges.


                                       9


<PAGE>

     In the event of the bankruptcy of a broker through which the Fund engages
in transactions in futures or options thereon, the Fund could experience delays
and/or losses in liquidating open positions purchased or sold through the
broker and/or incur a loss of all or part of its margin deposits with the
broker.


     If the Fund maintains a short position in a futures contract or has sold a
call option on a futures contract, it will cover this position by holding, in a
segregated account maintained on the books of the Fund, cash, U.S. government
securities or other liquid portfolio securities equal in value (when added to
any initial or variation margin on deposit) to the market value of the
securities underlying the futures contract or the exercise price of the option.
Such a position may also be covered by owning the securities underlying the
futures contract (in the case of a stock index futures contract a portfolio of
securities substantially replicating the relevant index), or by holding a call
option permitting the Fund to purchase the same contract at a price no higher
than the price at which the short position was established.


     In addition, if the Fund holds a long position in a futures contract or
has sold a put option on a futures contract, it will hold cash, U.S. government
securities or other liquid portfolio securities equal to the purchase price of
the contract or the exercise price of the put option (less the amount of
initial or variation margin on deposit) in a segregated account maintained on
the books of the Fund. Alternatively, the Fund could cover its long position by
purchasing a put option on the same futures contract with an exercise price as
high or higher than the price of the contract held by the Fund.

     MONEY MARKET SECURITIES. In addition to the money market securities in
which the Fund may otherwise invest, the Fund may invest in various money
market securities for cash management purposes or when assuming a temporary
defensive position, which among others may include commercial paper, bank
acceptances, bank obligations, corporate debt securities, certificates of
deposit, U.S. government securities, obligations of savings institutions and
repurchase agreements. Such securities are limited to:

     U.S. Government Securities. Obligations issued or guaranteed as to
principal and interest by the United States or its agencies (such as the
Export-Import Bank of the United States, Federal Housing Administration and
Government National Mortgage Association) or its instrumentalities (such as the
Federal Home Loan Bank), including Treasury bills, notes and bonds;

     Bank Obligations. Obligations (including certificates of deposit, time
deposits and bankers' acceptances) of banks subject to regulation by the U.S.
Government and having total assets of $1 billion or more, and instruments
secured by such obligations, not including obligations of foreign branches of
domestic banks except to the extent below;

     Eurodollar Certificates of Deposit. Eurodollar certificates of deposit
issued by foreign branches of domestic banks having total assets of $1 billion
or more;

     Obligations of Savings Institutions. Certificates of deposit of savings
banks and savings and loan associations, having total assets of $1 billion or
more;

     Fully Insured Certificates of Deposit. Certificates of deposit of banks
and savings institutions, having total assets of less than $1 billion, if the
principal amount of the obligation is federally insured by the Bank Insurance
Fund or the Savings Association Insurance Fund (each of which is administered
by the FDIC), limited to $100,000 principal amount per certificate and to 15%
or less of the Fund's net assets in all such obligations and in all illiquid
assets, in the aggregate;

     Commercial Paper. Commercial paper rated within the two highest grades by
Standard & Poor's Corporation ("S&P") or by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
("Moody's") or, if not rated, issued by a company having an outstanding debt
issue rated at least AAA by S&P or Aaa by Moody's; and

     Repurchase Agreements. The Fund may invest in repurchase agreements. When
cash may be available for only a few days, it may be invested by the Fund in
repurchase agreements until such time as it may otherwise be invested or used
for payments of obligations of the Fund. These agreements, which may be viewed
as a type of secured lending by the Fund, typically involve the acquisition by
the Fund of debt securities from a selling financial institution such as a
bank, savings and loan association or broker-dealer. The agreement provides
that the Fund will sell back to the institution, and that the


                                       10


<PAGE>

institution will repurchase, the underlying security serving as collateral at a
specified price and at a fixed time in the future, usually not more than seven
days from the date of purchase. The collateral will be marked-to-market daily
to determine that the value of the collateral, as specified in the agreement,
does not decrease below the purchase price plus accrued interest. If such
decrease occurs, additional collateral will be requested and, when received,
added to the account to maintain full collateralization. The Fund will accrue
interest from the institution until the time when the repurchase is to occur.
Although this date is deemed by the Fund to be the maturity date of a
repurchase agreement, the maturities of securities subject to repurchase
agreements are not subject to any limits.


     While repurchase agreements involve certain risks not associated with
direct investments in debt securities, the Fund follows procedures approved by
the Trustees which are designed to minimize such risks. These procedures
include effecting repurchase transactions only with large, well-capitalized and
well-established financial institutions whose financial condition will be
continually monitored by the Investment Manager. In addition, as described
above, the value of the collateral underlying the repurchase agreement will be
at least equal to the repurchase price, including any accrued interest earned
on the repurchase agreement. In the event of a default or bankruptcy by a
selling financial institution, the Fund will seek to liquidate such collateral.
However, the exercising of the Fund's right to liquidate such collateral could
involve certain costs or delays and, to the extent that proceeds from any sale
upon a default of the obligation to repurchase were less than the repurchase
price, the Fund could suffer a loss. It is the current policy of the Fund not
to invest in repurchase agreements that do not mature within seven days if any
such investment, together with any other illiquid assets held by the Fund,
amounts to more than 15% of its net assets.

     LENDING PORTFOLIO SECURITIES. The Fund may lend its portfolio securities
to brokers, dealers and other financial institutions, provided that the loans
are callable at any time by the Fund, and are at all times secured by cash or
cash equivalents, which are maintained in a segregated account pursuant to
applicable regulations and that are equal to at least 100% of the market value,
determined daily, of the loaned securities. The advantage of these loans is
that the Fund continues to receive the income on the loaned securities while at
the same time earning interest on the cash amounts deposited as collateral,
which will be invested in short-term obligations. The Fund will not lend more
than 25% of the value of its net assets.


     As with any extensions of credit, there are risks of delay in recovery
and, in some cases, even loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower
of the securities fail financially. However, these loans of portfolio
securities will only be made to firms deemed by the Fund's management to be
creditworthy and when the income which can be earned from such loans justifies
the attendant risks. Upon termination of the loan, the borrower is required to
return the securities to the Fund. Any gain or loss in the market price during
the loan period would inure to the Fund.

     When voting or consent rights which accompany loaned securities pass to
the borrower, the Fund will follow the policy of calling the loaned securities,
to be delivered within one day after notice, to permit the exercise of the
rights if the matters involved would have a material effect on the Fund's
investment in the loaned securities. The Fund will pay reasonable finder's,
administrative and custodial fees in connection with a loan of its securities.

     WHEN-ISSUED AND DELAYED DELIVERY SECURITIES AND FORWARD COMMITMENTS. From
time to time the Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued or delayed
delivery basis or may purchase or sell securities on a forward commitment
basis. When these transactions are negotiated, the price is fixed at the time
of the commitment, but delivery and payment can take place a month or more
after the date of commitment. While the Fund will only purchase securities on a
when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis with the intention of
acquiring the securities, the Fund may sell the securities before the
settlement date, if it is deemed advisable. The securities so purchased or sold
are subject to market fluctuation and no interest or dividends accrue to the
purchaser prior to the settlement date.

     At the time the Fund makes the commitment to purchase or sell securities
on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis, it will record
the transaction and thereafter reflect the value, each day, of such security
purchased, or if a sale, the proceeds to be received, in determining its net
asset value. At the time of delivery of the securities, their value may be more
or less than the


                                       11


<PAGE>

purchase or sale price. An increase in the percentage of the Fund's assets
committed to the purchase of securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or
forward commitment basis may increase the volatility of its net asset value.
The Fund will also establish a segregated account on the Fund's books in which
it will continually maintain cash or cash equivalents or other liquid portfolio
securities equal in value to commitments to purchase securities on a
when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis.


     WHEN, AS AND IF ISSUED SECURITIES. The Fund may purchase securities on a
"when, as and if issued" basis, under which the issuance of the security
depends upon the occurrence of a subsequent event, such as approval of a
merger, corporate reorganization or debt restructuring. The commitment for the
purchase of any such security will not be recognized in the portfolio of the
Fund until the Investment Manager determines that issuance of the security is
probable. At that time, the Fund will record the transaction and, in
determining its net asset value, will reflect the value of the security daily.
At that time, the Fund will also establish a segregated account on the Fund's
books in which it will maintain cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government
securities or other liquid portfolio securities equal in value to recognized
commitments for such securities.


     An increase in the percentage of the Fund's total assets committed to the
purchase of securities on a "when, as and if issued" basis may increase the
volatility of its net asset value. The Fund may also sell securities on a
"when, as and if issued" basis provided that the issuance of the security will
result automatically from the exchange or conversion of a security owned by the
Fund at the time of sale.

     PRIVATE PLACEMENTS. The Fund may invest up to 15% of its net assets in
securities which are subject to restrictions on resale because they have not
been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), or
which are otherwise not readily marketable. (Securities eligible for resale
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and determined to be liquid
pursuant to the procedures discussed in the following paragraph, are not
subject to the foregoing restriction.) These securities are generally referred
to as private placements or restricted securities. Limitations on the resale of
these securities may have an adverse effect on their marketability, and may
prevent the Fund from disposing of them promptly at reasonable prices. The Fund
may have to bear the expense of registering the securities for resale and the
risk of substantial delays in effecting the registration.

     Rule 144A permits the Fund to sell restricted securities to qualified
institutional buyers without limitation. The Investment Manager, pursuant to
procedures adopted by the Trustees, will make a determination as to the
liquidity of each restricted security purchased by the Fund. If a restricted
security is determined to be "liquid," the security will not be included within
the category "illiquid securities," which may not exceed 15% of the Fund's net
assets. However, investing in Rule 144A securities could have the effect of
increasing the level of Fund illiquidity to the extent the Fund, at a
particular point in time, may be unable to find qualified institutional buyers
interested in purchasing such securities.


     WARRANTS AND SUBSCRIPTION RIGHTS. The Fund may acquire warrants and
subscription rights attached to other securities. A warrant is, in effect, an
option to purchase equity securities at a specific price, generally valid for a
specific period of time, and has no voting rights, pays no dividends and has no
rights with respect to the corporation issuing it.


     A subscription right is a privilege granted to existing shareholders of a
corporation to subscribe to shares of a new issue of common stock before it is
offered to the public. A subscription right normally has a life of two to four
weeks and a subscription price lower than the current market value of the
common stock.

     ZERO COUPON SECURITIES. A portion of the fixed-income securities purchased
by the Fund may be zero coupon securities. Such securities are purchased at a
discount from their face amount, giving the purchaser the right to receive
their full value at maturity. The interest earned on such securities is,
implicitly, automatically compounded and paid out at maturity. While such
compounding at a constant rate eliminates the risk of receiving lower yields
upon reinvestment of interest if prevailing interest rates decline, the owner
of a zero coupon security will be unable to participate in higher yields upon
reinvestment of interest received on interest-paying securities if prevailing
interest rates rise.

     A zero coupon security pays no interest to its holder during its life.
Therefore, to the extent the Fund invests in zero coupon securities, it will
not receive current cash available for distribution to shareholders.


                                       12


<PAGE>

In addition, zero coupon securities are subject to substantially greater price
fluctuations during periods of changing prevailing interest rates than are
comparable securities which pay interest on a current basis. Current federal
tax law requires that a holder (such as the Fund) of a zero coupon security
accrue a portion of the discount at which the security was purchased as income
each year even though the Fund receives no interest payments in cash on the
security during the year.


     FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. The Fund may enter into
forward foreign currency exchange contracts ("forward contracts") to facilitate
settlement or in an attempt to limit the effect of changes in the relationship
between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currency during the period between the
date on which the security is purchased or sold and the date on which payment
is made or received. The Fund may conduct its foreign currency exchange
transactions either on a spot (i.e., cash) basis at the spot rate prevailing in
the foreign currency exchange market, or through entering into forward
contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies. A forward contract involves
an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date, which
may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by
the parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. These contracts are
traded in the interbank market conducted directly between currency traders
(usually large commercial and investment banks) and their customers. Forward
contracts will only be entered into with U.S. banks and their foreign branches,
insurance companies or other dealers or foreign banks whose assets total $1
billion or more. A forward contract generally has no deposit requirement, and
no commissions are charged at any stage for trades.

     The Fund may enter into forward contracts under various circumstances. The
typical use of a forward contract is to "lock in " the price of a security in
U.S. dollars or some other foreign currency which the Fund is holding in its
portfolio. By entering into a forward contract for the purchase or sale, for a
fixed amount of dollars or other currency, of the amount of foreign currency
involved in the underlying security transactions, the Fund may be able to
protect itself against a possible loss resulting from an adverse change in the
relationship between the U.S. dollar or other currency which is being used for
the security purchase and the foreign currency in which the security is
denominated during the period between the date on which the security is
purchased or sold and the date on which payment is made or received.


     The Investment Manager also may from time to time utilize forward
contracts to hedge a foreign security held in the portfolio or a security which
pays out principal tied to an exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and a
foreign currency, against a decline in value of the applicable foreign
currency. They also may be used to lock in the current exchange rate of the
currency in which those securities anticipated to be purchased are denominated.
At times, the Fund may enter into "cross-currency" hedging transactions
involving currencies other than those in which securities are held or proposed
to be purchased are denominated.


     The Fund will not enter into forward contracts or maintain a net exposure
to these contracts where the consummation of the contracts would obligate the
Fund to deliver an amount of foreign currency in excess of the value of the
Fund's portfolio securities.


     When required by law, the Fund will cause its custodian bank to earmark
cash, U.S. government securities or other appropriate liquid portfolio
securities in an amount equal to the value of the Fund's total assets committed
to the consummation of forward contracts entered into under the circumstances
set forth above. If the value of such securities so earmarked declines,
additional cash or securities will be earmarked on a daily basis so that the
value of such securities will equal the amount of the Fund's commitments with
respect to such contracts.

     Although the Fund values its assets daily in terms of U.S. dollars, it
does not intend to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars
on a daily basis. It will, however, do so from time to time, and investors
should be aware of the costs of currency conversion. Although foreign exchange
dealers do not charge a fee for conversion, they do realize a profit based on
the spread between the prices at which they are buying and selling various
currencies. Thus, a dealer may offer to sell a foreign currency to the Fund at
one rate, while offering a lesser rate of exchange should the Fund desire to
resell that currency to the dealer.

     The Fund may be limited in its ability to enter into hedging transactions
involving forward contracts by the Internal Revenue Code requirements relating
to qualification as a regulated investment company.


                                       13


<PAGE>


     Forward contracts may limit gains on portfolio securities that could
otherwise be realized had they not been utilized and could result in losses.
The contracts also may increase the Fund's volatility and may involve a
significant amount of risk relative to the investment of cash.


     DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS. Depositary Receipts represent an ownership interest
in securities of foreign companies (an "underlying issuer") that are deposited
with a depositary. Depositary Receipts are not necessarily denominated in the
same currency as the underlying securities. Depositary Receipts include
American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs"), Global Depositary Receipts ("GDRs") and
other types of Depositary Receipts (which, together with ADRs and GDRs, are
hereinafter collectively referred to as "Depositary Receipts"). ADRs are
dollar-denominated Depositary Receipts typically issued by a U.S. financial
institution which evidence an ownership interest in a security or pool of
securities issued by a foreign issuer. ADRs are listed and traded in the United
States. GDRs and other types of Depositary Receipts are typically issued by
foreign banks or trust companies, although they also may be issued by U.S.
financial institutions, and evidence ownership interests in a security or pool
of securities issued by either a foreign or a U.S. corporation. Generally,
Depositary Receipts in registered form are designed for use in the U.S.
securities market and Depositary Receipts in bearer form are designed for use
in securities markets outside the United States.

     Depositary Receipts may be "sponsored" or "unsponsored." Sponsored
Depositary Receipts are established jointly by a depositary and the underlying
issuer, whereas unsponsored Depositary Receipts may be established by a
depositary without participation by the underlying issuer. Holders of
unsponsored Depositary Receipts generally bear all the costs associated with
establishing unsponsored Depositary Receipts. In addition, the issuers of the
securities underlying unsponsored Depositary Receipts are not obligated to
disclose material information in the United States and, therefore, there may be
less information available regarding such issuers and there may not be a
correlation between such information and the market value of the Depositary
Receipts. For purposes of the Fund's investment policies, the Fund's
investments in Depositary Receipts will be deemed to be an investment in the
underlying securities, except that ADRs may be deemed to be issued by a U.S.
issuer.


     SWAPS. The Fund may enter into swap contracts. A swap is a derivative in
the form of an agreement to exchange the return generated by one instrument for
the return generated by another instrument. The payment streams are calculated
by reference to a specified index and agreed upon notional amount. The term
"specified index" includes currencies, fixed interest rates, prices, total
return on interest rate indices, fixed-income indices, stock indices and
commodity indices (as well as amounts derived from arithmetic operations on
these indices). For example, the Fund may agree to swap the return generated by
a fixed-income index for the return generated by a second fixed-income index.
The currency swaps in which the Fund may enter will generally involve an
agreement to pay interest streams in one currency based on a specified index in
exchange for receiving interest streams denominated in another currency. Such
swaps may involve initial and final exchanges that correspond to the agreed
upon notional amount.

     The swaps in which the Fund may engage also include rate caps, floors and
collars under which one party pays a single or periodic fixed amount(s) (or
premium), and the other party pays periodic amounts based on the movement of a
specified index. Swaps do not involve the delivery of securities, other
underlying assets, or principal. Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to
swaps is limited to the net amount of payments that the Fund is contractually
obligated to make. If the other party to a swap defaults, the Fund's risk of
loss consists of the net amount of payments that the Fund is contractually
entitled to receive. Currency swaps usually involve the delivery of the entire
principal value of one designated currency in exchange for the other designated
currency. Therefore, the entire principal value of a currency swap is subject
to the risk that the other party to the swap will default on its contractual
delivery obligations. If there is a default by the counterparty, the Fund may
have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the
transaction. The swap market has grown substantially in recent years with a
large number of banks and investment banking firms acting both as principals
and as agents utilizing standardized swap documentation. As a result, the swap
market has become relatively liquid. Caps, floors, and collars are more recent
innovations for which standardized documentation has not yet been fully
developed and, accordingly, they are less liquid than swaps.


                                       14


<PAGE>


     The Fund will usually enter into swaps on a net basis, i.e., the two
payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or
dates specified in the instrument, with the Fund receiving or paying, as the
case may be, only the net amount of the two payments. The Fund's obligations
under a swap agreement will be accrued daily (offset against any amounts owing
to the Fund) and any accrued but unpaid net amounts owed to a swap counterparty
will be covered by the maintenance of a segregated account consisting of cash
or liquid securities to avoid any potential leveraging of the Fund. To the
extent that these swaps, caps, floors, and collars are entered into for hedging
purposes, the Investment Manager believes such obligations do not constitute
"senior securities" under the Investment Company Act, and, accordingly, will
not treat them as being subject to the Fund's borrowing restrictions. The Fund
may enter into OTC derivatives transactions (swaps, caps, floors, puts, etc.,
but excluding foreign exchange contracts) with counterparties that are approved
by the Investment Manager in accordance with guidelines established by the
Board. These guidelines provide for a minimum credit rating for each
counterparty and various credit enhancement techniques (for example,
collateralization of amounts due from counterparties) to limit exposure to
counterparties with ratings below AA.


     Interest rate and total rate of return swaps do not involve the delivery
of securities, other underlying assets, or principal. Accordingly, the risk of
loss with respect to interest rate and total rate of return swaps is limited to
the net amount of interest payments that the Fund is contractually obligated to
make. If the other party to an interest rate or total rate of return swap
defaults, the Fund's risk of loss consists of the net amount of interest
payments that the Fund is contractually entitled to receive. In contrast,
currency swaps may involve the delivery of the entire principal value of one
designated currency in exchange for the other designated currency. Therefore,
the entire principal value of a currency swap may be subject to the risk that
the other party to the swap will default on its contractual delivery
obligations. If there is a default by the counterparty, the Fund may have
contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction.

     The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment
techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary Fund
securities transactions. If the Investment Manager were incorrect in its
forecasts of market values, interest rates, and currency exchange rates, the
investment performance of the Fund would be less favorable than it would have
been if this investment technique were not used.


     INVESTMENT IN REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS. The Fund may invest in real
estate investment trusts (also known as "REITs"), which pool investors' funds
for investments primarily in commercial real estate properties. Investment in
real estate investment trusts may be the most practical available means for the
Fund to invest in the real estate industry (the Fund is prohibited from
investing in real estate directly). As a shareholder in a REIT, the Fund would
bear its ratable share of the real estate investment trust's expenses,
including its advisory and administration fees. At the same time the Fund would
continue to pay its own investment management fees and other expenses, as a
result of which the Fund and its shareholders in effect will be absorbing
duplicate levels of fees with respect to investments in REITs.


     REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The Fund may also use reverse repurchase
agreements as part of its investment strategy. Reverse repurchase agreements
involve sales by the Fund of portfolio assets concurrently with an agreement by
the Fund to repurchase the same assets at a later date at a fixed price.
Generally, the effect of such a transaction is that the Fund can recover all or
most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities involved during the term
of the reverse repurchase agreement, while it will be able to keep the interest
income associated with those portfolio securities. Such transactions are only
advantageous if the interest cost to the Fund of the reverse repurchase
transaction is less than the cost of obtaining the cash otherwise.
Opportunities to achieve this advantage may not always be available, and the
Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when it will be to
its advantage to do so. The Fund will establish a segregated account with its
custodian bank in which it will maintain cash or cash equivalents or other
portfolio securities equal in value to its obligations in respect of reverse
repurchase agreements. Reverse repurchase agreements are considered borrowings
by the Fund and for purposes other than meeting redemptions may not exceed 5%
of the Fund's total assets.


     OTHER INVESTMENT VEHICLES. The Fund may acquire shares in other investment
companies, including foreign investment companies. Investment in foreign
investment companies may be the sole or



                                       15


<PAGE>


most practical means by which the Fund may participate in certain foreign
securities markets. The Fund may invest in shares of various exchange-traded
funds ("ETFs"), including exchange-traded index and bond funds. Exchange traded
index funds seek to track performance of various securities indices. Shares of
ETFs have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or
bonds. In addition, their market value is expected to rise and fall as the
value of the underlying index or bonds rise and fall. The market value of their
shares may differ from the net asset value of the particular fund. As a
shareholder in an investment company, the Fund would bear its ratable share of
that entity's expenses, including its advisory and administration fees. At the
same time, the Fund would continue to pay its own investment management fees
and other expenses. As a result, the Fund and its shareholders, in effect, will
be absorbing duplicate levels of fees with respect to investments in other
investment companies.



C.   FUND POLICIES/INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS

     The investment objective, policies and restrictions listed below have been
adopted by the Fund as fundamental policies. Under the Investment Company Act,
a fundamental policy may not be changed without the vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Fund. The Investment Company Act defines a
majority as the lesser of (a) 67% or more of the shares present at a meeting of
shareholders, if the holders of 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are
present or represented by proxy; or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding shares
of the Fund. For purposes of the following restrictions: (i) all percentage
limitations apply immediately after a purchase or initial investment; and (ii)
any subsequent change in any applicable percentage resulting from market
fluctuations or other changes in total or net assets does not require
elimination of any security from the portfolio.

     The Fund will:

1.   Seek to maximize total investment return over different stages of an
     economic cycle.

     The Fund may not:

1.   Invest 25% or more of the value of its total assets in securities of
     issuers in any one industry. This restriction does not apply to obligations
     issued or guaranteed by the United States government, its agencies or
     instrumentalities.

2.   Purchase or sell real estate or interests therein, although the Fund may
     purchase securities of issuers which engage in real estate operations and
     securities secured by real estate or interests therein, except that the
     Fund may invest in real estate limited partnership interests.

3.   Borrow money, except that the Fund may borrow from a bank for temporary or
     emergency purposes in amounts not exceeding 5% (taken at the lower of cost
     or current value) of its total assets (not including the amount borrowed).


4.   Issue senior securities as defined in the Investment Company Act except
     insofar as the Fund may be deemed to have issued a senior security by
     reason of (a) entering into any repurchase agreement; (b) purchasing any
     securities on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis; (c) purchasing or
     selling any futures contracts; (d) borrowing money; or (e) lending
     portfolio securities.

5.   Make loans of money or securities, except: (a) by the purchase of portfolio
     securities; (b) by investment in repurchase agreements; or (c) by lending
     its portfolio securities.

6.   Purchase or sell commodities or commodities contracts except that the Fund
     may purchase or sell futures contracts or options thereon.

7.   Engage in the underwriting of securities, except insofar as the Fund may be
     deemed an underwriter under the Securities Act in disposing of a portfolio
     security.

     In addition, as a non-fundamental policy, the Fund may not invest in other
investment companies in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F), 12(d)(1)(G) or
12(d)(1)(J) of the Investment Company Act.

     Notwithstanding any other investment policy or restriction, the Fund may
seek to achieve its investment objective by investing all or substantially all
of its assets in another investment company having substantially the same
investment objective and policies as the Fund.

III. MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.   BOARD OF TRUSTEES

     The Board of Trustees of the Fund oversees the management of the Fund but
does not itself manage the Fund. The Trustees review various services provided
by or under the direction of the Investment Manager to ensure that the Fund's
general investment policies and programs are properly carried out. The Trustees
also conduct their review to ensure that administrative services are provided
to the Fund in a satisfactory manner.

     Under state law, the duties of the Trustees are generally characterized as
a duty of loyalty and a duty of care. The duty of loyalty requires a Trustee to
exercise his or her powers in the interest of the Fund and not the Trustee's
own interest or the interest of another person or organization. A Trustee
satisfies his or her duty of care by acting in good faith with the care of an
ordinarily prudent person and in a manner the Trustee reasonably believes to be
in the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.


B.   MANAGEMENT INFORMATION

     Effective July 31, 2003, the Board of Directors/Trustees (for ease of
reference referred to herein as "Trustees") of the Fund elected Joseph J.
Kearns and Fergus Reid to serve as Independent Trustees on the Board of the
Fund, thereby consolidating the existing Board of the Fund with the Board of
Directors/Trustees of the open-end and closed-end registered investment
companies managed by Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc.

     TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS. The Board of the Fund consists of nine Trustees.
These same individuals also serve as directors or trustees for all of the funds

(1)  Includes the total amount of compensation deferred by the Director at his
     election pursuant to a deferred compensation plan. Such deferred
     compensation is placed in a deferral account and deemed to be invested in
     one or more of the Retail Funds or Institutional Funds (or portfolio
     thereof) that are offered as investment options under the plan. As of
     December 31, 2003, Messrs. Kearns and Reid had deferred a total of $430,361
     and $600,512, respectively, pursuant to the deferred compensation plan.

     As to each Independent Trustee and his immediate family members, no person
owned beneficially or of record securities in an investment advisor or
principal underwriter of the Fund, or a person (other than a registered
investment company) directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under
common control with an investment advisor or principal underwriter of the Fund.

     INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES AND THE COMMITTEES. Law and regulation establish both
general guidelines and specific duties for the Independent Trustees. The Retail
Funds seek as Independent Trustees individuals of distinction and experience in
business and finance, government service or academia; these are people whose
advice and counsel are in demand by others and for whom there is often
competition. To accept a position on the Retail Funds' boards, such individuals
may reject other attractive assignments because the Retail Funds make
substantial demands on their time. All of the Independent Trustees serve as
members of the Audit Committee. In addition, three Trustees including two
Independent Trustees, serve as members of the Insurance Committee, and three
Independent Trustees serve as members of the Governance Committee.

     The Independent Trustees are charged with recommending to the full Board
approval of management, advisory and administration contracts, Rule 12b-1 plans
and distribution and underwriting agreements; continually reviewing fund
performance; checking on the pricing of portfolio securities, brokerage
commissions, transfer agent costs and performance, and trading among funds in
the same complex; and approving fidelity bond and related insurance coverage
and allocations, as well as other matters that arise from time to time. The
Independent Trustees are required to select and nominate individuals to fill
any Independent Trustee vacancy on the board of any fund that has a Rule 12b-1
plan of distribution. Most of the Retail Funds have a Rule 12b-1 plan.

     The Board of Trustees of each fund has a separately-designated standing
Audit Committee established in accordance with section 3(a)(58)(A) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.



                                       22


<PAGE>


The Audit Committee is charged with recommending to the full Board the
engagement or discharge of the Funds' independent auditors; directing
investigations into matters within the scope of the independent auditors'
duties, including the power to retain outside specialists; reviewing with the
independent auditors the audit plan and results of the auditing engagement;
approving professional services provided by the independent auditors and other
accounting firms prior to the performance of the services; reviewing the
independence of the independent auditors; considering the range of audit and
non-audit fees; reviewing the adequacy of the Funds' system of internal
controls; and preparing and submitting Committee meeting minutes to the full
Board. Each Fund has adopted a formal, written Audit Committee Charter. During
the Fund's fiscal year ended January 31, 2004, the Audit Committee held seven
meetings.

     The members of the Audit Committee of each Fund are currently Michael
Bozic, Edwin J. Garn, Wayne E. Hedien, Dr. Manuel H. Johnson, Joseph J. Kearns,
Michael Nugent and Fergus Reid. None of the members of the Funds' Audit
Committees is an "interested person," as defined under the Investment Company
Act, of any of the Funds (with such disinterested Trustees being "Independent
Trustees" or individually, "Independent Trustee"). Each Independent Trustee is
also "independent" from each Fund under the listing standards of the New York
Stock Exchange, Inc. (NYSE). The current Chairman of the Audit Committee of all
of the Funds is Dr. Manuel H. Johnson.

     The Board of Trustees of each Fund also has a Governance Committee. The
Governance Committee identifies individuals qualified to serve as Independent
Trustees on each Fund's Board and on committees of such Board and recommends
such qualified individuals for nomination by the Fund's Independent Trustees as
candidates for election as Independent Trustees, advises each Fund's Board with
respect to Board composition, procedures and committees, develops and
recommends to each Fund's Board a set of corporate governance principles
applicable to the Funds, monitors and makes recommendations on corporate
governance matters and policies and procedures of the Fund's Board of Trustees
and any Board committees and oversees periodic evaluations of the Fund's Board
and its committees. The members of the Governance Committee of each Fund are
currently Michael Bozic, Edwin J. Garn and Fergus Reid, each of whom is an
Independent Trustee. The current Chairman of each Governance Committee is
Fergus Reid. No Fund's Governance Committee met during the fiscal year ended
January 31, 2004.

     None of the Funds has a separate nominating committee. While each Fund's
Governance Committee recommends qualified candidates for nominations as
Independent Trustees, the Board of Trustees of each Fund believes that the task
of nominating prospective Independent Trustees is important enough to require
the participation of all current Independent Trustees, rather than a separate
committee consisting of only certain Independent Trustees. Accordingly, each
current Independent Trustee (Michael Bozic, Edwin J. Garn, Wayne E. Hedien, Dr.
Manuel H. Johnson, Joseph J. Kearns, Michael Nugent and Fergus Reid, for all
Funds) participates in the election and nomination of candidates for election
as Independent Trustees for the respective Funds for which the Independent
Trustee serves. Persons recommended by each Fund's Governance Committee as
candidates for nomination as Independent Trustees shall possess such knowledge,
experience, skills, expertise and diversity so as to enhance the Board's
ability to manage and direct the affairs and business of the Fund, including,
when applicable, to enhance the ability of committees of the Board to fulfill
their duties and/or to satisfy any independence requirements imposed by law,
regulation or any listing requirements of the NYSE. While the Independent
Trustees of each of the Funds expect to be able to continue to identify from
their own resources an ample number of qualified candidates for each Fund's
Board as they deem appropriate, they will consider nominations from
shareholders to the Board. Nominations from shareholders should be in writing
and sent to the Independent Trustees as described below.

     There were seven meetings of the Board of Trustees of each Fund held
during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. The Independent Trustees of
each of the Funds also met twice during that time, in addition to the seven
meetings of the full Boards. For the 2003 fiscal year, each Trustee attended at
least seventy-five percent of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and
of any committee on which he served held during the time such Trustee was a
member of the Board.

     Finally, the Boards have formed an Insurance Committee to review and
monitor the insurance coverage maintained by the Fund. The Insurance Committee
currently consists of Messrs. Nugent,

Fiumefreddo and Hedien. During the Fund's fiscal year ended January 31, 2004,
the Insurance Committee held three meetings. The Derivatives Committee was
eliminated as of July 31, 2003.

     ADVANTAGES OF HAVING SAME INDIVIDUALS AS TRUSTEES FOR THE RETAIL FUNDS AND
INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS. The Independent Trustees and the Funds' management believe
that having the same Independent Trustees for each of the Retail Funds and
Institutional Funds avoids the duplication of effort that would arise from
having different groups of individuals serving as Independent Trustees for each
of the funds or even of sub-groups of funds. They believe that having the same
individuals serve as Independent Trustees of all the Retail Funds and
Institutional Funds tends to increase their knowledge and expertise regarding
matters which affect the Fund Complex generally and enhances their ability to
negotiate on behalf of each fund with the Fund's service providers. This
arrangement also precludes the possibility of separate groups of Independent
Trustees arriving at conflicting decisions regarding operations and management
of the Funds and avoids the cost and confusion that would likely ensue.
Finally, having the same Independent Trustees serve on all fund boards enhances
the ability of each fund to obtain, at modest cost to each separate fund, the
services of Independent Trustees, of the caliber, experience and business
acumen of the individuals who serve as Independent Trustees of the Retail Funds
and Institutional Funds.

     TRUSTEE AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION. The Fund's Declaration of Trust
provides that no Trustee, Officer, employee or agent of the Fund is liable to
the Fund or to a shareholder, nor is any Trustee, Officer, employee or agent
liable to any third persons in connection with the affairs of the Fund, except
as such liability may arise from his/her or its own bad faith, willful
misfeasance, gross negligence or reckless disregard of his/her or its duties.
It also provides that all third persons shall look solely to Fund property for
satisfaction of claims arising in connection with the affairs of the Fund. With
the exceptions stated, the Declaration of Trust provides that a Trustee,
officer, employee or agent is entitled to be indemnified against all liability
in connection with the affairs of the Fund.

     SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS. Shareholders may send communications to each
Fund's Board of Trustees. Shareholders should send communications intended for
each Fund's Board by addressing the communications directly to that Board (or
individual Board members) and/or otherwise clearly indicating in the salutation
that the communication is for the Board (or individual Board members) and by
sending the communication to either the Fund's office or directly to such Board
member(s) at the address specified for each trustee previously noted. Other
shareholder communications received by the Funds not directly addressed and
sent to the Boards will be reviewed and generally responded to by management,
and will be forwarded to the Board only at management's discretion based on the
matters contained therein.

C.   COMPENSATION

     Effective August 1, 2003, each Independent Trustee receives an annual
retainer fee of $168,000 for serving the Retail Funds and the Institutional
Funds. In addition, each Independent Trustee receives $2,000 for attending each
of the four quarterly board meetings and two performance meetings that occur
each year, so that an Independent Trustee who attended all six meetings would
receive total compensation of $180,000 for serving the Funds. The Chairman of
the Audit Committee receives an additional annual retainer fee of $60,000.
Other Committee Chairmen and the Deputy Chairman of the Audit Committee receive
an additional annual retainer fee of $30,000. The aggregate compensation paid
to each Independent Trustee is paid by the Retail Funds and the Institutional
Funds, and is allocated on a pro rata basis among each of the operational
funds/portfolios of the Retail Funds and the Institutional Funds based on the
relative net assets of each of the funds/portfolios. Mr. Fiumefreddo receives
an annual fee for his services as Chairman of the Boards of the Retail Funds
and the Institutional Funds and for administrative services provided to each
Board.

     The Fund also reimburses such Trustees for travel and other out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with attending such meetings. Trustees
and officers of the Fund who are employed by the Investment Manager or an
affiliated company receive no compensation or expense reimbursement from the
Fund for their services as Trustee.

     Prior to August 1, 2003, the Fund paid each Independent Trustee an annual
fee of $800 plus a per meeting fee of $50 for meetings of the Board of
Trustees, the Independent Trustees or Committees of



                                       24


<PAGE>


the Board of Trustees attended by the Trustee (the Fund paid the Chairman of
the Audit Committee an additional annual fee of $750, and the Chairmen of the
Derivatives and Insurance Committees additional annual fees of $500). With the
exception of an Audit Committee Meeting, if a Board meeting and a meeting of
the Independent Trustees and/or one or more Committee meetings took place on a
single day, the Trustees were paid a single meeting fee by the Fund.

     Effective April 1, 2004, the Fund began an unfunded Deferred Compensation
Plan (the "Plan"), which allows each Independent Trustee to defer payment of
all, or a portion, of the fees he or she receives for serving on the Board of
Trustees throughout the year. Each eligible Trustee generally may elect to have
the deferred amounts credited with a return equal to the total return on one or
more of the Retail Funds or Institutional Funds (or portfolios thereof) that
are offered as investment options under the Plan. At the Trustee's election,
distributions are either in one lump sum payment, or in the form of equal
annual installments over a period of five years. The Fund intends that the
Deferred Compensation Plan shall be maintained at all times on an unfunded
basis for federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"). The rights of an eligible Trustee and the
beneficiaries to the amounts held under the Deferred Compensation Plan are
unsecured and such amounts are subject to the claims of the creditors of the
Fund.

     Prior to April 1, 2004, the Institutional Funds maintained a similar
unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Prior Plan") which also allowed each
Independent Trustee to defer payment of all, or a portion, of the fees he or
she received for serving on the Board of Trustees throughout the year. The Plan
amends and supersedes the Prior Plan and all amounts payable under the Prior
Plan are now subject to the terms of the Plan (except for amounts due to be
paid during the calendar year 2004 which will remain subject to the terms of
the Prior Plan).

     The following table shows aggregate compensation paid to the Fund's
Trustees from the Fund for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004. Messrs.
Kearns and Reid began serving as Trustees of the Fund on July 31, 2003.

     respectively.

     Prior to December 31, 2003, 49 of the Retail Funds (the "Adopting Funds"),
had adopted a retirement program under which an Independent Trustee who retired
after serving for at least five years as an Independent Trustee of any such
fund (an "Eligible Trustee") would have been entitled to retirement payments
based on factors such as length of service, upon reaching the eligible
retirement age. On December 31, 2003, the amount of accrued retirement benefits
for each Eligible Trustee was frozen, and will be payable, together with a
return of 8% per annum, at or following each such Eligible Trustee's retirement
as shown in the table below.

     The following table illustrates the retirement benefits accrued to the
Fund's Independent Trustees by the 49 Retail Funds (not including the Fund) for
the calendar year ended December 31, 2003, and the estimated retirement
benefits for the Independent Trustees, from the 49 Retail Funds for each
calendar year following retirement. Messrs. Kearns and Reid did not participate
in the retirement program.

V. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND OTHER SERVICES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. INVESTMENT MANAGER


     The Investment Manager to the Fund is Morgan Stanley Investment Advisors
Inc., a Delaware corporation, whose address is 1221 Avenue of the Americas, New
York, NY 10020. The Investment Manager is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Morgan
Stanley, a Delaware corporation. Morgan Stanley is a preeminent global
financial services firm that maintains leading market positions in each of its
three primary businesses: securities, asset management and credit services.


     Pursuant to an Investment Management Agreement (the "Management
Agreement") with the Investment Manager, the Fund has retained the Investment
Manager to provide administrative services and to manage the business affairs
of the Fund. The Fund pays the Investment Manager monthly compensation
calculated daily by applying the annual rate of 0.75% to the net assets of the
Fund determined as of the close of each business day. The management fee is
allocated among the Classes pro rata based on the net assets of the Fund
attributable to each Class. For the fiscal period February 26, 2003
(commencement of operations) through January 31, 2004, the Investment Manager
accrued total compensation under the Management Agreement in the amount of
$1,161,372.


     The Investment Manager has retained its wholly-owned subsidiary, Morgan
Stanley Services, to perform administrative services for the Fund.


     In approving the Management Agreement, the Board of Trustees, including
the Independent Trustees, considered the nature, quality and scope of the
services to be provided by the Investment Manager; the performance, fees and
expenses of the Fund compared to other similar investment companies; the
Investment Manager's expenses in providing the services; the profitability of
the Investment Manager and its affiliated companies and other benefits they
derive from their relationship with the Fund; and the extent to which economies
of scale are shared with the Fund. The Independent Trustees met with and
reviewed reports from third parties about the foregoing factors and changes, if
any, in such items since the preceding year's deliberations. The Independent
Trustees noted their confidence in the capability and integrity of the senior
management and staff of the Investment Manager and the financial strength of
the Investment Manager and its affiliated companies. The Independent Trustees
weighed the foregoing factors in light of the advice given to them by their
legal counsel as to the law applicable to the review of investment advisory
contracts. Based upon its review, the Board of Trustees, including all of the
Independent Trustees, determined, in the exercise of its business judgment,
that approval of the Management Agreement was in the best interests of the Fund
and shareholders.



B. PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER

     The Fund's principal underwriter is the Distributor (which has the same
address as the Investment Manager). In this capacity, the Fund's shares are
distributed by the Distributor. The Distributor has entered into a selected
dealer agreement with Morgan Stanley DW, which through its own sales
organization sells shares of the Fund. In addition, the Distributor may enter
into similar agreements with other selected broker-dealers. The Distributor, a
Delaware corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley.

     The Distributor bears all expenses it may incur in providing services
under the Distribution Agreement. These expenses include the payment of
commissions for sales of the Fund's shares and incentive compensation to
Financial Advisors, the cost of educational and/or business-related trips, and
educational and/or promotional and business-related expenses. The Distributor
also pays certain expenses in connection with the distribution of the Fund's
shares, including the costs of preparing, printing and distributing advertising
or promotional materials, and the costs of printing and distributing
prospectuses and supplements thereto used in connection with the offering and
sale of the Fund's shares. The Fund bears the costs of initial typesetting,
printing and distribution of prospectuses and supplements thereto to
shareholders. The Fund also bears the costs of registering the Fund and its
shares under federal and state securities laws and pays filing fees in
accordance with state securities laws.


                                       27


<PAGE>

     The Fund and the Distributor have agreed to indemnify each other against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Under the
Distribution Agreement, the Distributor uses its best efforts in rendering
services to the Fund, but in the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith,
gross negligence or reckless disregard of its obligations, the Distributor is
not liable to the Fund or any of its shareholders for any error of judgment or
mistake of law or for any act or omission or for any losses sustained by the
Fund or its shareholders.


C. SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE INVESTMENT MANAGER

     The Investment Manager manages the investment of the Fund's assets,
including the placing of orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio
securities. The Investment Manager obtains and evaluates the information and
advice relating to the economy, securities markets, and specific securities as
it considers necessary or useful to continuously manage the assets of the Fund
in a manner consistent with its investment objective.

     Under the terms of the Management Agreement, in addition to managing the
Fund's investments, the Investment Manager maintains certain of the Fund's
books and records and furnishes, at its own expense, the office space,
facilities, equipment, clerical help, bookkeeping and certain legal services as
the Fund may reasonably require in the conduct of its business, including the
preparation of prospectuses, proxy statements and reports required to be filed
with federal and state securities commissions (except insofar as the
participation or assistance of independent auditors and attorneys is, in the
opinion of the Investment Manager, necessary or desirable). The Investment
Manager also bears the cost of telephone service, heat, light, power and other
utilities provided to the Fund.

     Expenses not expressly assumed by the Investment Manager under the
Management Agreement, or by the Distributor, will be paid by the Fund. These
expenses will be allocated among the four Classes of shares pro rata based on
the net assets of the Fund attributable to each Class, except as described
below. Such expenses include, but are not limited to: expenses of the Plan of
Distribution pursuant to Rule 12b-1; charges and expenses of any registrar,
custodian, stock transfer and dividend disbursing agent; brokerage commissions;
taxes; engraving and printing share certificates; registration costs of the
Fund and its shares under federal and state securities laws; the cost and
expense of printing, including typesetting, and distributing prospectuses of
the Fund and supplements thereto to the Fund's shareholders; all expenses of
shareholders' and Trustees' meetings and of preparing, printing and mailing of
proxy statements and reports to shareholders; fees and travel expenses of
Trustees or members of any advisory board or committee who are not employees of
the Investment Manager or any corporate affiliate of the Investment Manager;
all expenses incident to any dividend, withdrawal or redemption options;
charges and expenses of any outside service used for pricing of the Fund's
shares; fees and expenses of legal counsel, including counsel to the Trustees
who are not interested persons of the Fund or of the Investment Manager (not
including compensation or expenses of attorneys who are employees of the
Investment Manager); fees and expenses of the Fund's independent auditors;
membership dues of industry associations; interest on Fund borrowings; postage;
insurance premiums on property or personnel (including officers and Trustees)
of the Fund which inure to its benefit; extraordinary expenses (including, but
not limited to, legal claims and liabilities and litigation costs and any
indemnification relating thereto); and all other costs of the Fund's operation.
The 12b-1 fees relating to a particular Class will be allocated directly to
that Class. In addition, other expenses associated with a particular Class
(except advisory or custodial fees) may be allocated directly to that Class,
provided that such expenses are reasonably identified as specifically
attributable to that Class and the direct allocation to that Class is approved
by the Trustees.

     The Management Agreement provides that in the absence of willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its
obligations thereunder, the Investment Manager is not liable to the Fund or any
of its investors for any act or omission by the Investment Manager or for any
losses sustained by the Fund or its investors.

     The Management Agreement will remain in effect from year to year, provided
continuance of the Management Agreement is approved at least annually by the
vote of the holders of a majority, as defined in the Investment Company Act, of
the outstanding shares of the Fund, or by the Trustees, including a


                                       28


<PAGE>


majority of the Independent Trustees; provided that in either event such
continuance is approved annually by the vote of a majority of the Independent
Trustees.



D. DEALER REALLOWANCES

     Upon notice to selected broker-dealers, the Distributor may reallow up to
the full applicable front-end sales charge during periods specified in such
notice. During periods when 90% or more of the sales charge is reallowed, such
selected broker-dealers may be deemed to be underwriters as that term is
defined in the Securities Act.


E. RULE 12b-1 PLAN


     The Fund has adopted a Plan of Distribution pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under
the Investment Company Act (the "Plan") pursuant to which each Class, other
than Class D, pays the Distributor compensation accrued daily and payable
monthly at the following maximum annual rates: 0.25%, 1.0% and 1.0% of the
average daily net assets of Class A, Class B and Class C, respectively.

     The Distributor also receives the proceeds of front-end sales charges
("FSCs") and of contingent deferred sales charges ("CDSCs") imposed on certain
redemptions of shares, which are separate and apart from payments made pursuant
to the Plan. The Distributor has informed the Fund that it and/or Morgan
Stanley DW received the proceeds of CDSCs and FSCs, for the fiscal period
February 26, 2003 (commencement of operations) through January 31, 2004, in
approximate amounts as provided in the table below (the Distributor did not
retain any of these amounts).





<TABLE>

                        FEBRUARY 26, 2003
                             THROUGH
                        JANUARY 31, 2004

Class C .........   CDSCs:        $ 21,985
</TABLE>



----------
(1)   FSCs apply to Class A only.


     The Distributor has informed the Fund that the entire fee payable by Class
A and a portion of the fees payable by each of Class B and Class C each year
pursuant to the Plan equal to 0.25% of such Class' average daily net assets are
currently each characterized as a "service fee" under the Rules of the NASD (of
which the Distributor is a member). The "service fee" is a payment made for
personal service and/or the maintenance of shareholder accounts. The remaining
portion of the Plan fees payable by a Class, if any, is characterized as an
"asset-based sales charge" as such is defined by the Rules of the NASD.

     Under the Plan and as required by Rule 12b-1, the Trustees receive and
review promptly after the end of each calendar quarter a written report
provided by the Distributor of the amounts expended under the Plan and the
purpose for which such expenditures were made. For the fiscal period February
26, 2003 through January 31, 2004, Class A, Class B and Class C shares of the
Fund accrued payments under the Plan amounting to $34,501, $1,094,570 and
$166,763, respectively, which amounts are equal to 0.21%, 1.00% and 1.00% or
the average daily net assets of Class A, Class B and Class C, respectively, for
the fiscal period.


     The Plan was adopted in order to permit the implementation of the Fund's
method of distribution. Under this distribution method the Fund offers four
Classes, each with a different distribution arrangement.


     With respect to Class A shares, Morgan Stanley DW compensates its
Financial Advisors by paying them, from proceeds of the FSC, commissions for
the sale of Class A shares, currently a gross sales credit of up to 5.0% of the
amount sold (except as provided in the following sentence) and an annual
residual commission, currently a residual of up to 0.25% of the current value
of the respective accounts for which they are the Financial Advisors or dealers
of record in all cases.


                                       29


<PAGE>


     With respect to Class B shares, Morgan Stanley DW compensates its
Financial Advisors by paying them, from its own funds, commissions for the sale
of Class B shares, currently a gross sales credit of up to 4.0% of the amount
sold and an annual residual commission, currently a residual of up to 0.25% of
the current value (not including reinvested dividends or distributions) of the
amount sold in all cases.


     With respect to Class C shares, Morgan Stanley DW compensates its
Financial Advisors by paying them, from its own funds, commissions for the sale
of Class C shares, currently a gross sales credit of up to 1.0% of the amount
sold and an annual residual commission, currently up to 1.0% of the current
value of the respective accounts for which they are the Financial Advisors of
record.


     The gross sales credit is a charge which reflects commissions paid by
Morgan Stanley DW to its Financial Advisors and Morgan Stanley DW's
Fund-associated distribution-related expenses, including sales compensation,
and overhead and other branch office distribution-related expenses including
(a) the expenses of operating Morgan Stanley DW's branch offices in connection
with the sale of Fund shares, including lease costs, the salaries and employee
benefits of operations and sales support personnel, utility costs,
communications costs and the costs of stationery and supplies; (b) the costs of
client sales seminars; (c) travel expenses of mutual fund sales coordinators to
promote the sale of Fund shares; and (d) other expenses relating to branch
promotion of Fund sales.



     The distribution fee that the Distributor receives from the Fund under the
Plan, in effect, offsets distribution expenses incurred under the Plan on
behalf of the Fund and, in the case of Class B shares, opportunity costs, such
as an assumed interest charged on the gross sales credit in the manner
described below ("carrying charge"). These expenses may include the cost of
Fund-related educational and/or business-related trips or payment of
Fund-related educational and/or promotional expenses of Financial Advisors. For
example, the Distributor has implemented a compensation program available only
to Financial Advisors meeting specified criteria under which certain marketing
and/or promotional expenses of those Financial Advisors are paid by the
Distributor out of compensation it receives under the Plan. In the
Distributor's reporting of the distribution expenses to the Fund, in the case
of Class B shares, such assumed interest (computed at the "broker's call rate")
has been calculated on the gross credit as it is reduced by amounts received by
the Distributor under the Plan and any contingent deferred sales charges
received by the Distributor upon redemption of shares of the Fund. No other
interest charge is included as a distribution expense in the Distributor's
calculation of its distribution costs for this purpose. The broker's call rate
is the interest rate charged to securities brokers on loans secured by
exchange-listed securities.


     The Fund is authorized to reimburse expenses incurred or to be incurred in
promoting the distribution of the Fund's Class A and Class C shares and in
servicing shareholder accounts. Reimbursement will be made through payments at
the end of each month. The amount of each monthly payment may in no event
exceed an amount equal to a payment at the annual rate of 0.25%, in the case of
Class A, and 1.0%, in the case of Class C, of the average net assets of the
respective Class during the month. No interest or other financing charges, if
any, incurred on any distribution expenses on behalf of Class A and Class C
will be reimbursable under the Plan. With respect to Class A, in the case of
all expenses other than expenses representing the service fee, and, with
respect to Class C, in the case of all expenses other than expenses
representing a gross sales credit or a residual to Financial Advisors and other
authorized financial representatives, such amounts shall be determined at the
beginning of each calendar quarter by the Trustees, including, a majority of
the Independent Trustees. Expenses representing the service fee (for Class A)
or a gross sales credit or a residual to Financial Advisors and other
authorized financial representatives (for Class C) may be reimbursed without
prior determination. In the event that the Distributor proposes that monies
shall be reimbursed for other than such expenses, then in making quarterly
determinations of the amounts that may be reimbursed by the Fund, the
Distributor will provide and the Trustees will review a quarterly budget of
projected distribution expenses to be incurred on behalf of the Fund, together
with a report explaining the purposes and anticipated benefits of incurring
such expenses. The Trustees will determine which particular expenses, and the
portions thereof, that may be borne by the Fund, and in making such a
determination shall consider the scope of the Distributor's commitment to
promoting the distribution of the Fund's Class A and Class C shares.

     Each Class paid 100% of the amounts accrued under the Plan with respect to
that Class for the fiscal period February 26, 2003 (commencement of operations)
to January 31, 2004 to the Distributor. The Distributor and Morgan Stanley DW
estimate that they have spent, pursuant to the Plan, $6,301,128 on behalf of
Class B since the inception of the Plan. It is estimated that this amount was
spent in approximately the following ways: (i) 2.62% ($164,810) - advertising
and promotional expenses; (ii) 0% ($0.00) - printing of prospectuses for
distribution to other than current shareholders; and (iii) 97.38% ($6,136,318)
- other expenses, including the gross sales credit and the carrying charge, of
which 0.83% ($50,769) represents carrying charges, 41.05% ($2,519,417)
represents commission credits to Morgan Stanley DW's branch offices and other
selected broker-dealers for payments of commissions to Financial Advisors and
other authorized financial representatives, and $58.12% ($3,566,132) represents
overhead and other branch office distribution-related expenses. The amounts
accrued by Class A and a portion of the amounts accrued by Class C under the
Plan during the fiscal period ended January 31, 2004 were service fees. The
remainder of the amounts accrued by Class C were for expenses which relate to
compensation of sales personnel and associated overhead expenses.

     In the case of Class B shares, at any given time, the expenses of
distributing shares of the Fund may be more or less than the total of (i) the
payments made by the Fund pursuant to the Plan; and (ii) the proceeds of CDSCs
paid by investors upon redemption of shares. For example, if $1 million in
expenses in distributing Class B shares of the Fund had been incurred and
$750,000 had been received as described in (i) and (ii) above, the excess
expense would amount to $250,000. The Distributor has advised the Fund that in
the case of Class B shares the excess distribution expenses, including the
carrying charge designed to approximate the opportunity costs incurred by
Morgan Stanley DW which arise from it having advanced monies without having
received the amount of any sales charges imposed at the time of sale of the
Fund's Class B shares, totaled $4,869,930 as of January 31, 2004 (end of the
Fund's fiscal period), which was equal to 3.10% or the net assets of Class B on
such date. Because there is no requirement under the Plan that the Distributor
be reimbursed for all distribution expenses with respect to Class B shares or
any requirement that the Plan be continued from year to year, this excess
amount does not constitute a liability of the Fund. Although there is no legal
obligation for the Fund to pay expenses incurred in excess of payments made to
the Distributor under the Plan and the proceeds of CDSCs paid by investors upon
redemption of shares, if for any reason the Plan is terminated, the Trustees
will consider at that time the manner in which to treat such expenses. Any
cumulative expenses incurred, but not yet recovered through distribution fees
or CDSCs, may or may not be recovered through future distribution fees or
CDSCs.

     In the case of Class A and Class C shares, expenses incurred pursuant to
the Plan in any calendar year in excess of 0.25% or 1.0% of the average daily
net assets of Class A or Class C, respectively, will not be reimbursed by the
Fund through payments in any subsequent year, except that expenses representing
a gross sales commission credited to Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors and
other authorized financial representatives at the time of sale may be
reimbursed in the subsequent calendar year. The Distributor has advised the
Fund that unreimbursed expenses representing a gross sales commission credited
to Morgan Stanley Fnancial Advisors and other authorized financial
representatives at the time of sale totaled $62,335 in the case of Class C at
December 31, 2003 (the end of the calendar year), which amount was equal to
0.29% of the net assets of Class C on such date, and that there were such
expenses that may be reimbursed in the subsequent year in the case of Class A
on such date. No interest or other financing charges will be incurred on any
Class A or Class C distribution expenses incurred by the Distributor under the
Plan or on any unreimbursed expenses due to the Distributor pursuant to the
Plan.

     No interested person of the Fund nor any Independent Trustee has any
direct financial interest in the operation of the Plan except to the extent
that the Distributor, the Investment Manager, Morgan Stanley DW, Morgan Stanley
Services or certain of their employees may be deemed to have such an interest
as a result of benefits derived from the successful operation of the Plan or as
a result of receiving a portion of the amounts expended thereunder by the Fund.


     On an annual basis, the Trustees, including a majority of the Independent
Trustees, consider whether the Plan should be continued. Prior to approving the
last continuation of the Plan, the Trustees requested and received from the
Distributor and reviewed all the information which they deemed


                                       31


<PAGE>


necessary to arrive at an informed determination. In making their determination
to continue the Plan, the Trustees considered: (1) the Fund's experience under
the Plan and whether such experience indicates that the Plan is operating as
anticipated; (2) the benefits the Fund had obtained, was obtaining and would be
likely to obtain under the Plan, including that: (a) the Plan is essential in
order to give Fund investors a choice of alternatives for payment of
distribution and service charges and to enable the Fund to continue to grow and
avoid a pattern of net redemptions which, in turn, are essential for effective
investment management; and (b) without the compensation to individual brokers
and the reimbursement of distribution and account maintenance expenses of
Morgan Stanley DW's branch offices made possible by the 12b-1 fees, Morgan
Stanley DW could not establish and maintain an effective system for
distribution, servicing of Fund shareholders and maintenance of shareholder
accounts; and (3) what services had been provided and were continuing to be
provided under the Plan to the Fund and its shareholders. Based upon their
review, the Trustees, including each of the Independent Trustees, determined
that continuation of the Plan would be in the best interest of the Fund and
would have a reasonable likelihood of continuing to benefit the Fund and its
shareholders.

     The Plan may not be amended to increase materially the amount to be spent
for the services described therein without approval by the shareholders of the
affected Class or Classes of the Fund, and all material amendments to the Plan
must also be approved by the Trustees. The Plan may be terminated at any time,
without payment of any penalty, by vote of a majority of the Independent
Trustees or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the
Fund (as defined in the Investment Company Act) on not more than 30 days'
written notice to any other party to the Plan. So long as the Plan is in
effect, the election and nomination of Independent Trustees shall be committed
to the discretion of the Independent Trustees.

G. CODES OF ETHICS

     The Fund, the Investment Manager and the Distributor have each adopted a
Code of Ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act. The
Codes of Ethics are designed to detect and prevent improper personal trading.
The Codes of Ethics permit personnel subject to the Codes to invest in
securities, including securities that may be purchased, sold or held by the
Fund, subject to a

                                       32


<PAGE>

number of restrictions and controls including prohibitions against purchases of
securities in an Initial Public Offering and a preclearance requirement with
respect to personal securities transactions.


VI. BROKERAGE ALLOCATION AND OTHER PRACTICES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS


     Subject to the general supervision of the Trustees, the Investment Manager
is responsible for decisions to buy and sell securities for the Fund, the
selection of brokers and dealers to effect the transactions, and the
negotiation of brokerage commissions, if any. Purchases and sales of securities
on a stock exchange are effected through brokers who charge a commission for
their services. In the over-the-counter market, securities are generally traded
on a "net" basis with dealers acting as principal for their own accounts
without a stated commission, although the price of the security usually
includes a profit to the dealer. The Fund also expects that securities will be
purchased at times in underwritten offerings where the price includes a fixed
amount of compensation, generally referred to as the underwriter's concession
or discount. Options and futures transactions will usually be effected through
a broker and a commission will be charged. On occasion, the Fund may also
purchase certain money market instruments directly from an issuer, in which
case no commissions or discounts are paid.


     For the fiscal period February 26, 2003 (commencement of operations)
through January 31, 2004, the Fund paid a total of $838,600 in brokerage
commissions.



B. COMMISSIONS

     Pursuant to an order of the SEC, the Fund may effect principal
transactions in certain money market instruments with Morgan Stanley DW. The
Fund will limit its transactions with Morgan Stanley DW to U.S. Government and
government agency securities, bank money instruments (i.e., certificates of
deposit and bankers' acceptances) and commercial paper. The transactions will
be effected with Morgan Stanley DW only when the price available from Morgan
Stanley DW is better than that available from other dealers.


     During the fiscal period ended January 31, 2004, the Fund did not effect
any principal transactions with Morgan Stanley DW.


     Brokerage transactions in securities listed on exchanges or admitted to
unlisted trading privileges may be effected through Morgan Stanley DW, Morgan
Stanley & Co. and other affiliated brokers and dealers. In order for an
affiliated broker or dealer to effect any portfolio transactions on an exchange
for the Fund, the commissions, fees or other remuneration received by the
affiliated broker or dealer must be reasonable and fair compared to the
commissions, fees or other remuneration paid to other brokers in connection
with comparable transactions involving similar securities being purchased or
sold on an exchange during a comparable period of time. This standard would
allow the affiliated broker or dealer to receive no more than the remuneration
which would be expected to be received by an unaffiliated broker in a
commensurate arm's-length transaction. Furthermore, the Trustees, including the
Independent Trustees, have adopted procedures which are reasonably designed to
provide that any commissions, fees or other remuneration paid to an affiliated
broker or dealer are consistent with the foregoing standard. The Fund does not
reduce the management fee it pays to the Investment Manager by any amount of
the brokerage commissions it may pay to an affiliated broker or dealer.


     During the fiscal period ended January 31, 2004, the Fund did not pay any
brokerage commissions to Morgan Stanley DW. During the fiscal period ended
January 31, 2004, the Fund paid a total of $110,371 in brokerage commissions to
Morgan Stanley & Co. During the fiscal period ended January 31, 2004, the
brokerage commissions paid to Morgan Stanley & Co. represented approximately
13.16% of the total brokerage commissions paid by the Fund during the period
and were paid on account of transactions having an aggregate dollar value equal
to approximately 15.27% of the aggregate dollar value of all portfolio
transactions of the Fund during the period for which commissions were paid.



C. BROKERAGE SELECTION

     The policy of the Fund regarding purchases and sales of securities for its
portfolio is that primary consideration will be given to obtaining the most
favorable prices and efficient executions of transactions.


                                       33


<PAGE>

Consistent with this policy, when securities transactions are effected on a
stock exchange, the Fund's policy is to pay commissions which are considered
fair and reasonable without necessarily determining that the lowest possible
commissions are paid in all circumstances. The Fund believes that a requirement
always to seek the lowest possible commission cost could impede effective
portfolio management and preclude the Fund and the Investment Manager from
obtaining a high quality of brokerage and research services. In seeking to
determine the reasonableness of brokerage commissions paid in any transaction,
the Investment Manager relies upon their experience and knowledge regarding
commissions generally charged by various brokers and on its judgment in
evaluating the brokerage and research services received from the broker
effecting the transaction. These determinations are necessarily subjective and
imprecise, as in most cases an exact dollar value for those services is not
ascertainable. The Fund anticipates that certain of its transactions involving
foreign securities will be effected on foreign securities exchanges. Fixed
commissions on such transactions are generally higher than negotiated
commissions on domestic transactions. There is also generally less government
supervision and regulation of foreign securities exchanges and brokers than in
the United States.

     In seeking to implement the Fund's policies, the Investment Manager
effects transactions with those brokers and dealers who the Investment Manager
believes provide the most favorable prices and are capable of providing
efficient executions. If the Investment Manager believes the prices and
executions are obtainable from more than one broker or dealer, they may give
consideration to placing portfolio transactions with those brokers and dealers
who also furnish research and other services to the Fund or the Investment
Manager. The services may include, but are not limited to, any one or more of
the following: information as to the availability of securities for purchase or
sale; statistical or factual information or opinions pertaining to investment;
wire services; and appraisals or evaluations of portfolio securities. The
information and services received by the Investment Manager from brokers and
dealers may be utilized by the Investment Manager and any of its asset
management affiliates in the management of accounts of some of their other
clients and may not in all cases benefit the Fund directly.

     The Investment Manager and certain of its affiliates each currently serve
as investment manager to a number of clients, including other investment
companies, and may in the future act as investment manager or advisor to
others. It is the practice of the Investment Manager and its affiliates to
cause purchase and sale transactions to be allocated among clients whose assets
they manage (including the Fund) in such manner as they deem equitable. In
making such allocations among the Fund and other client accounts, various
factors may be considered, including the respective investment objectives, the
relative size of portfolio holdings of the same or comparable securities, the
availability of cash for investment, the size of investment commitments
generally held and the opinions of the persons responsible for managing the
portfolios of the Fund and other client accounts. The Investment Manager and
its affiliates may operate one or more order placement facilities and each
facility will implement order allocation in accordance with the procedures
described above. From time to time, each facility may transact in a security at
the same time as other facilities are trading in that security.



D. DIRECTED BROKERAGE

     During the fiscal period February 26, 2003 (commencement of operations)
through January 31, 2004, the Fund paid $580,051 in brokerage commissions in
connection with transactions in the aggregate amount of $448,229,090 to brokers
because of research services provided.


E. REGULAR BROKER-DEALERS

     During the fiscal period ended January 31, 2004, the Fund purchased
securities issued by Bank of America Corp., The Bank of New York, Bear, Stearns
& Co., Inc., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.,
Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. and UBS AG., which
issuers were among the ten brokers or ten dealers which executed transactions
for or with the Fund in the largest dollar amounts during the period. At
January 31, 2004, the Fund held securities issued by Bank of America Corp.,
Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co., JP Morgan Chase & Co., Lehman Brothers
Holdings, Inc., Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. and UBS AG, with market values of
$855,330, $4,086,948, $1,907,232, $396,799, $1,724,100, $1,704,910 and
$1,103,718, respectively.


                                       34

F. REVENUE SHARING

     The Adviser and/or the Distributor may pay compensation, out of their own
resources and not as an additional charge to the Fund, to Morgan Stanley DW and
certain unaffiliated brokers, dealers or other financial intermediaries
("Intermediaries") in connection with the sale, distribution, retention and/or
servicing of Fund shares. For example, the Adviser or the Distributor may pay
additional compensation to Morgan Stanley DW and to Intermediaries for the
purpose of promoting the sale of Fund shares, maintaining share balances and/or
for sub-accounting, administrative or shareholder processing services. Such
payments are in addition to any distribution-related or transfer
agency/shareholder servicing fees that may be payable by the Fund or by the
Distributor. The additional payments may be based on current assets, gross
sales, the Fund's advisory fee or other measures as determined from time to
time by the Adviser or Distributor. The amount of these payments, as determined
from time to time by the Adviser or the Distributor, may be substantial and may
be different for different Intermediaries.

     These payments currently include the following amounts:

       (1)   On sales of $1 million or more of Class A shares (for which no
             sales charge was paid) or net asset value purchases by certain
             employee benefit plans, Morgan Stanley DW and other Intermediaries
             receive a gross sales credit of 1.00% of the amount sold which is
             paid to Financial Advisors and Intermediaries' salespersons in
             accordance with the applicable compensation structure.

       (2)   On sales of Class D shares (for which no sales charge was paid),
             Morgan Stanley DW and other Intermediaries receive a gross sales
             credit of up to 1.00% of the amount sold and an annual residual
             commission of up to 0.10% of the current value of the accounts
             which is paid to Financial Advisors and Intermediaries'
             salespersons in accordance with the applicable compensation
             structure. There is a chargeback of 100% of the gross sales credit
             amount paid if the Class D shares are redeemed in the first year
             and a chargeback of 50% of the gross sales credit amount paid if
             the shares are redeemed in the second year.

       (3)   On sales (except purchases through 401(k) platforms) through
             Morgan Stanley DW's Partners Program:(1)

          o   An amount equal to 0.20% of gross sales of Fund shares;

          o   For those shares purchased beginning January 1, 2001, an annual
              fee in an amount up to 0.05% of the value of such Fund shares
              held for a one-year period or more; and

          o   An amount equal to 0.025% on the value of Money Market Fund
              shares acquired by exchange from another open-end retail fund and
              whose shares had been held for a one-year period or more.

       (4)   An amount equal to 0.20% on the value of shares sold through
             401(k) platforms.

     The prospect of receiving, or the receipt of, additional compensation, as
described above, by Morgan Stanley DW or other Intermediaries may provide
Morgan Stanley DW or other Intermediaries and/or Financial Advisors and other
salespersons with an incentive to favor sales of shares of the Fund over other
investment options with respect to which Morgan Stanley DW or an Intermediary
does not receive additional compensation (or receives lower levels of
additional compensation). These payment arrangements, however, will not change
the price that an investor pays for shares of the Fund or the amount that the
Fund receives to invest on behalf of an investor. Investors may wish to take
such payment arrangements into account when considering and evaluating any
recommendations relating to Fund shares.

     In addition to the payments described above, Morgan Stanley reports its
segment results utilizing an allocation methodology which reflects the
economics of each business segment by representing


----------

(1)   Thirteen of the largest and most well known mutual fund families are
      participants in Morgan Stanley DW's Partners Program, including the
      Morgan Stanley Funds. These fund families have greater access to
      Financial Advisers so that they can provide training and other
      presentations concerning their funds. The current participants in the
      Partners Program are AIM, AllianceBernstein, Davis, Dreyfus, Eaton Vance,
      Evergreen, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton Investments, Morgan Stanley
      Funds, PIMCO Advisors, Putnam, Scudder, and Van Kampen.


                                       35


<PAGE>


transactions as if conducted between a Morgan Stanley business segment and an
external party. Accordingly, for sales of Money Market Funds, an amount equal
to a portion of the Fund's advisory fee is reflected, for financial reporting
purposes only, as paid by the Investment Manager to a Morgan Stanley business
segment.



VII. CAPITAL STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The shareholders of the Fund are entitled to a full vote for each full
share of beneficial interest held. The Fund is authorized to issue an unlimited
number of shares of beneficial interest. All shares of beneficial interest of
the Fund are of $0.01 par value and are equal as to earnings, assets and voting
privileges except that each Class will have exclusive voting privileges with
respect to matters relating to distribution expenses borne solely by such Class
or any other matter in which the interests of one Class differ from the
interests of any other Class. In addition, Class B shareholders will have the
right to vote on any proposed material increase in Class A's expenses, if such
proposal is submitted separately to Class A shareholders. Also, Class A, Class
B and Class C bear expenses related to the distribution of their respective
shares.

     The Fund's Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to authorize the
creation of additional series of shares (the proceeds of which would be
invested in separate, independently managed portfolios) and additional Classes
of shares within any series. The Trustees have not presently authorized any
such additional series or Classes of shares other than as set forth in the
Prospectus.


     The Fund is not required to hold annual meetings of shareholders and in
ordinary circumstances the Fund does not intend to hold such meetings. The
Trustees may call special meetings of shareholders for action by shareholder
vote as may be required by the Investment Company Act or the Declaration of
Trust. Under certain circumstances the Trustees may be removed by action of the
Trustees. In addition, under certain circumstances the shareholders may call a
meeting to remove Trustees and the Fund is required to provide assistance in
communicating with shareholders about such a meeting. The voting rights of
shareholders are not cumulative, so that holders of more than 50% of the shares
voting can, if they choose, elect all Trustees being selected, while the
holders of the remaining shares would be unable to elect any Trustees.


     Under Massachusetts law, shareholders of a business trust may, under
certain limited circumstances, be held personally liable as partners for the
obligations of the Fund. However, the Declaration of Trust contains an express
disclaimer of shareholder liability for acts or obligations of the Fund,
requires that notice of such Fund obligations include such disclaimer, and
provides for indemnification out of the Fund's property for any shareholder
held personally liable for the obligations of the Fund. Thus, the risk of a
shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is
limited to circumstances in which the Fund itself would be unable to meet its
obligations. Given the above limitations on shareholder personal liability, and
the nature of the Fund's assets and operations, the possibility of the Fund
being unable to meet its obligations is remote and thus, in the opinion of
Massachusetts counsel to the Fund, the risk to Fund shareholders of personal
liability is remote.

     The Trustees themselves have the power to alter the number and the terms
of office of the Trustees (as provided for in the Declaration of Trust), and
they may at any time lengthen or shorten their own terms or make their terms of
unlimited duration and appoint their own successors, provided that always at
least a majority of the Trustees has been elected by the shareholders of the
Fund.


VIII. PURCHASE, REDEMPTION AND PRICING OF SHARES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. PURCHASE/REDEMPTION OF SHARES


     Information concerning how Fund shares are offered to the public (and how
they are redeemed and exchanged) is provided in the Fund's Prospectus.

     TRANSFER AGENT AS AGENT. With respect to the redemption or repurchase of
Fund shares, the application of proceeds to the purchase of new shares in the
Fund or any other Morgan Stanley Funds

                                       36


<PAGE>

and the general administration of the exchange privilege, the Transfer Agent
acts as agent for the Distributor and for the shareholder's authorized
broker-dealer, if any, in the performance of such functions. With respect to
exchanges, redemptions or repurchases, the Transfer Agent is liable for its own
negligence and not for the default or negligence of its correspondents or for
losses in transit. The Fund is not liable for any default or negligence of the
Transfer Agent, the Distributor or any authorized broker-dealer.

     The Distributor and any authorized broker-dealer have appointed the
Transfer Agent to act as their agent in connection with the application of
proceeds of any redemption of Fund shares to the purchase of shares of any
other Morgan Stanley Fund and the general administration of the exchange
privilege. No commission or discounts will be paid to the Distributor or any
authorized broker-dealer for any transactions pursuant to the exchange
privilege.

     TRANSFERS OF SHARES. In the event a shareholder requests a transfer of
Fund shares to a new registration, the shares will be transferred without sales
charge at the time of transfer. With regard to the status of shares which are
either subject to a CDSC or free of such charge (and with regard to the length
of time shares subject to the charge have been held), any transfer involving
less than all of the shares in an account will be made on a pro rata basis
(that is, by transferring shares in the same proportion that the transferred
shares bear to the total shares in the account immediately prior to the
transfer). The transferred shares will continue to be subject to any applicable
CDSC as if they had not been so transferred.

     OUTSIDE BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS. If a shareholder wishes to maintain his or her
fund account through a brokerage company other than Morgan Stanley DW, he or
she may do so only if the Distributor has entered into a selected dealer
agreement with that brokerage company. Fund accounts maintained through a
brokerage company other than Morgan Stanley DW may be subject to certain
restrictions on subsequent purchases and exchanges. Please contact your
brokerage company or the Transfer Agent for more information.

B. OFFERING PRICE

     The Fund's Class B, Class C and Class D shares are offered at net asset
value per share and the Class A shares are offered at net asset value per share
plus any applicable FSC which is distributed among the Fund's Distributor,
Morgan Stanley DW and other authorized dealers as described in Section "V.
Investment Management and Other Services-E. Rule 12b-1 Plan." The price of Fund
shares, called "net asset value," is based on the value of the Fund's portfolio
securities. Net asset value per share of each Class is calculated by dividing
the value of the portion of the Fund's securities and other assets attributable
to that Class, less the liabilities attributable to that Class, by the number
of shares of that Class outstanding. The assets of each Class of shares are
invested in a single portfolio. The net asset value of each Class, however,
will differ because the Classes have different ongoing fees.


     In the calculation of the Fund's net assets value: (1) an equity portfolio
security listed or traded on the New York or American Stock Exchange, or other
exchange is valued at its latest sale price, prior to the time when assets are
valued; if there were no sales that day, the security is valued at the mean
between the last reported bid and asked price; (2) an equity portfolio security
listed or traded on the Nasdaq is valued at the Nasdaq Official Closing Price;
if there were no sales that day, the security is valued at the mean between the
last reported bid and asked price; and (3) all other portfolio securities for
which over-the-counter market quotations are readily available are valued at
the mean between the last reported bid and asked price. In cases where a
security is traded on more than one exchange, the security is valued on the
exchange designated as the primary market. For equity securities traded on
foreign exchanges, the last reported sale price or the latest bid price may be
used if there were no sales on a particular day. When market quotations are not
readily available, including circumstances under which it is determined by the
Investment Manager that the sale price, the bid price or the mean between the
latest reported bid and asked price are not reflective of a security's market
value, portfolio securities are valued at their fair value as determined in
good faith under procedures established by and under the general supervision of
the Fund's Trustees. For valuation purposes, quotations of foreign portfolio
securities, other assets and liabilities and forward contracts stated in
foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollar equivalents at the prevailing
market rates prior to the close of the New York Stock Exchange.

<PAGE>


     Short-term debt securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less at
the time of purchase are valued at amortized cost, unless the Trustees
determine such does not reflect the securities' market value, in which case
these securities will be valued at their fair value as determined by the
Trustees.


     Certain of the Fund's portfolio securities may be valued by an outside
pricing service approved by the Fund's Trustees. The pricing service may
utilize a matrix system incorporating security quality, maturity and coupon as
the evaluation model parameters, and/or research evaluations by its staff,
including review of broker-dealer market price quotations in determining what
it believes is the fair valuation of the portfolio securities valued by such
pricing service.


     Listed options on debt securities are valued at the latest sale price on
the exchange on which they are listed unless no sales of such options have
taken place that day, in which case they will be valued at the mean between
their latest bid and asked prices. Unlisted options on debt securities and all
options on equity securities are valued at the mean between their latest bid
and asked prices. Futures are valued at the latest price published by the
commodities exchange on which they trade unless it is determined that such
price does not reflect their market value, in which case they will be valued at
their fair value as determined in good faith under procedures established by
and under the supervision of the Trustees.


     Generally, trading in foreign securities, as well as corporate bonds, U.S.
government securities and money market instruments, is substantially completed
each day at various times prior to the close of the New York Stock Exchange.
The values of such securities used in computing the net asset value of the
Fund's shares are determined as of such times. Foreign currency exchange rates
are also generally determined prior to the close of the New York Stock
Exchange. Occasionally, events which may affect the values of such securities
and such exchange rates may occur between the times at which they are
determined and the close of the New York Stock Exchange and will therefore not
be reflected in the computation of the Fund's net asset value. If events that
may affect the value of such securities occur during such period, then these
securities may be valued at their fair value as determined in good faith under
procedures established by and under the supervision of the Trustees.


IX. TAXATION OF THE FUND AND SHAREHOLDERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Fund generally will make two basic types of distributions: ordinary
dividends and long-term capital gain distributions. These two types of
distributions are reported differently on a shareholder's income tax return.
The tax treatment of the investment activities of the Fund will affect the
amount, timing and character of the distributions made by the Fund. Tax issues
relating to the Fund are not generally a consideration for shareholders such as
tax-exempt entities and tax-advantaged retirement vehicles such as an IRA or
401(k) plan. Shareholders are urged to consult their own tax professionals
regarding specific questions as to federal, state or local taxes.

     INVESTMENT COMPANY TAXATION. The Fund intends to remain qualified as a
regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended. As such, the Fund will not be subject to federal income tax
on its net investment income and capital gains, if any, to the extent that it
timely distributes such income and capital gains to its shareholders.


     The Fund generally intends to distribute sufficient income and gains so
that the Fund will not pay corporate income tax on its earnings. The Fund also
generally intends to distribute to its shareholders in each calendar year a
sufficient amount of ordinary income and capital gains to avoid the imposition
of a 4% excise tax. However, the Fund may instead determine to retain all or
part of any net long-term capital gains in any year for reinvestment. In such
event, the Fund will pay federal income tax (and possibly excise tax) on such
retained gains.


     Gains or losses on sales of securities by the Fund will generally be
long-term capital gains or losses if the securities have a tax holding period
of more than one year at the time of such sale. Gains or losses on the sale of
securities with a tax holding period of one year or less will be short-term
capital gains or losses. Special tax rules may change the normal treatment of
gains and losses recognized by the Fund when the Fund invests in forward
foreign currency exchange contracts, options, futures transactions, and
non-U.S. corporations classified as "passive foreign investment companies"
("PFICs"). Those special tax rules can, among other things, affect the
treatment of capital gain or loss as long-term or short-term


                                       38


<PAGE>

and may result in ordinary income or loss rather than capital gain or loss. The
application of these special rules would therefore also affect the character of
distributions made by the Fund.


     Under certain tax rules, the Fund may be required to accrue a portion of
any discount at which certain securities are purchased as income each year even
though the Fund receives no payments in cash on the security during the year.
To the extent that the Fund invests in such securities, it would be required to
pay out such income as an income distribution in each year in order to avoid
taxation at the Fund level. Such distributions will be made from the available
cash of the Fund or by liquidation of portfolio securities if necessary. If a
distribution of cash necessitates the liquidation of portfolio securities, the
Investment Manager will select which securities to sell. The Fund may realize a
gain or loss from such sales. In the event the Fund realizes net capital gains
from such transactions, its shareholders may receive a larger capital gain
distribution, if any, than they would in the absence of such transactions.

     TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS. Shareholders normally wil be
subject to federal income taxes, and any state and/or local income taxes, on
the dividends and other distributions they receive from the Fund. Such
dividends and distributions, to the extent that they are derived from net
investment income or short-term capital gains, are generally taxable to the
shareholder as ordinary income regardless of whether the shareholder receives
such payments in additional shares or in cash. Under recently enacted
legislation, ordinary income dividends received by a shareholder may be taxed
at the same rate as long-term capital gains. However, even if income received
in the form of ordinary income dividends is taxed at the same rates as
long-term capital gains, such income will not be considered long-term capital
gains for other federal income tax purposes. For example, you generally will
not be permitted to offset ordinary income dividends with capital losses.
Short-term capital gain distribution will continue to be taxed at ordinary
income rates.

     Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to
shareholders as long-term capital gains regardless of how long a shareholder
has held the Fund's shares and regardless of whether the distribution is
received in additional shares or in cash. Under current law, the maximum tax
rate on long-term capital gains available to non-corporate shareholders
generally is 15%. Without future congressional action, the maximum tax rate on
long-term capital gains would return to 20% in 2009, and the maximum rate on
dividends would move to 35% in 2009 and 39.6% in 2011.


     Shareholders are generally taxed on any ordinary dividend or capital gain
distributions from the Fund in the year they are actually distributed. However,
if any such dividends or distributions are declared in October, November or
December and paid in January then such amounts will be treated for tax purposes
as received by the shareholders on December 31, to shareholders of record of
such month.

     Subject to certain exceptions, a corporate shareholder may be eligible for
a 70% dividends received deduction to the extent that the Fund earns and
distributes qualifying dividends from its investments. Distributions of net
capital gains by the Fund will not be eligible for the dividends received
deduction.

     Shareholders who are not citizens or residents of the United States and
certain foreign entities may be subject to withholding of United States tax on
distributions made by the Fund of investment income and short term capital
gains.

     After the end of each calendar year, shareholders will be sent information
on their dividends and capital gain distributions for tax purposes, including
the portion taxable as ordinary income, the portion taxable as long-term
capital gains and the amount of any dividends eligible for the federal
dividends received deduction for corporations.

     PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS AND EXCHANGES OF FUND SHARES. Any dividend or
capital gains distribution received by a shareholder from any investment
company will have the effect of reducing the net asset value of the
shareholder's stock in that company by the exact amount of the dividend or
capital gains distribution. Furthermore, such dividends and capital gains
distributions are subject to federal income taxes. If the net asset value of
the shares should be reduced below a shareholder's cost as a result of the
payment of dividends or the distribution of realized long-term capital gains,
such payment or distribution would be in part a return of the shareholder's
investment but nonetheless would be taxable to the shareholder. Therefore, an
investor should consider the tax implications of purchasing Fund shares
immediately prior to a distribution record date.

                                       39


<PAGE>


     In general, a sale of shares results in capital gain or loss, and for
individual shareholders, is taxable at a federal rate dependent upon the length
of time the shares were held. A redemption of a shareholder's Fund shares is
normally treated as a sale for tax purposes. Fund shares held for a period of
one year or less at the time of such sale or redemption will, for tax purposes,
generally result in short-term capital gains or losses and those held for more
than one year will generally result in long-term capital gains or losses. Under
current law, the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains available to
non-corporate shareholders generally is 15%. Without future congressional
action, the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains would return to 20% in
2009. Any loss realized by shareholders upon a sale or redemption of shares
within six months of the date of their purchase will be treated as a long-term
capital loss to the extent of any distributions of net long-term capital gains
with respect to such shares during the six-month period.


     Gain or loss on the sale or redemption of shares in the Fund is measured
by the difference between the amount received and the adjusted tax basis of the
shares. Shareholders should keep records of investments made (including shares
acquired through reinvestment of dividends and distributions) so they can
compute the tax basis of their shares. Under certain circumstances a
shareholder may compute and use an average cost basis in determining the gain
or loss on the sale or redemption of shares.


     Exchanges of Fund shares for shares of another fund, including shares of
other Morgan Stanley Funds, are also subject to similar tax treatment. Such an
exchange is treated for tax purposes as a sale of the original shares in the
Fund, followed by the purchase of shares in the other fund.


     The availability to deduct capital losses may be limited. In addition, if
a shareholder realizes a loss on the redemption or exchange of a fund's shares
and reinvests in that fund's shares or substantially identical shares within 30
days before or after the redemption or exchange, the transactions may be
subject to the "wash sale" rules, resulting in a postponement of the
recognition of such loss for tax purposes.



X. UNDERWRITERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Fund's shares are offered to the public on a continuous basis. The
Distributor, as the principal underwriter of the shares, has certain
obligations under the Distribution Agreement concerning the distribution of the
shares. These obligations and the compensation the Distributor receives are
described above in the sections titled "Principal Underwriter" and "Rule 12b-1
Plan."

Morgan Stanley Allocator Fund
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS [|] JANUARY 31, 2004


1. Organization and Accounting Policies
Morgan Stanley Allocator Fund (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), as a diversified, open-end
management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is selecting
securities with the potential to rise in price and/or pay out income. The Fund
seeks to achieve its objective by maximizing total investment return through
different stages of an economic cycle. The Fund was organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on October 25, 2002 and had no operations other
than those relating to organizational matters and the issuance of 2,500 shares
of beneficial interest by each class for $25,000 of each class to Morgan
Stanley Investment Advisors Inc. (the "Investment Manager"), to effect the
Fund's initial capitalization. The Fund commenced operations on February 26,
2003.

The Fund offers Class A shares, Class B shares, Class C shares and Class D
shares. The four classes are substantially the same except that most Class A
shares are subject to a sales charge imposed at the time of purchase and some
Class A shares, and most Class B shares and Class C shares are subject to a
contingent deferred sales charge imposed on shares redeemed within one year,
six years and one year, respectively. Class D shares are not subject to a sales
charge. Additionally, Class A shares, Class B shares and Class C shares incur
distribution expenses.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies:

A. Valuation of Investments - (1) an equity portfolio security listed or traded
on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") or American Stock Exchange or other
exchange is valued at its latest sale price prior to the time when assets are
valued; if there were no sales that day, the security is valued at the mean
between the last reported bid and asked price; (2) an equity portfolio security
listed or traded on the Nasdaq is valued at the Nasdaq Official Closing Price;
if there were no sales that day, the security is valued at the mean between the
last reported bid and asked price; (3) all other portfolio securities for which
over-the-counter market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean
between the last reported bid and asked price. In cases where a security is
traded on more than one exchange, the security is valued on the exchange
designated as the primary market; (4) for equity securities traded on foreign
exchanges, the last reported sale price or the latest bid price may be used if
there were no sales on a particular day; (5) futures are valued at the latest
price published by the commodities exchange on which they trade; (6) when
market quotations are not readily available or the Investment Manager
determines that the latest sale price, the bid price or the mean between the
last reported bid and asked price do not reflect a security's market value,
portfolio securities are valued at their fair value as determined in good faith
under procedures established by and under the general supervision of the Fund's
Trustees. Occasionally, developments affecting the closing prices of securities
and other assets may occur between the times at which valuations of such
securities are determined (that is, close of the foreign market on which the
securities trade) and the close of business on the NYSE. If developments occur
during such periods that are expected to materially affect the value of such
securities, such valuations may be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value
of such securities as of the

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS [|] JANUARY 31, 2004 continued


close of the NYSE, as determined in good faith by the Fund's Trustees or by the
Investment Manager using a pricing service and/or procedures approved by the
Trustees of the Fund; (7) certain portfolio securities may be valued by an
outside pricing service approved by the Fund's Trustees; and (8) short-term
debt securities having a maturity date of more than sixty days at time of
purchase are valued on a mark-to-market basis until sixty days prior to
maturity and thereafter at amortized cost based on their value on the 61st day.
Short-term debt securities having a maturity date of sixty days or less at the
time of purchase are valued at amortized cost.

B. Accounting for Investments - Security transactions are accounted for on the
trade date (date the order to buy or sell is executed). Realized gains and
losses on security transactions are determined by the identified cost method.
Dividend income and other distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
Discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized over the life of the
respective securities. Interest income is accrued daily.

C. Repurchase Agreements - Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Fund, along with other affiliated
entities managed by the Investment Manager, may transfer uninvested cash
balances into one or more joint repurchase agreement accounts. These balances
are invested in one or more repurchase agreements and are collateralized by
cash, U.S. Treasury or federal agency obligations. The Fund may also invest
directly with institutions in repurchase agreements. The Fund's custodian
receives the collateral, which is marked-to-market daily to determine that the
value of the collateral does not decrease below the repurchase price plus
accrued interest.

D. Multiple Class Allocations - Investment income, expenses (other than
distribution fees), and realized and unrealized gains and losses are allocated
to each class of shares based upon the relative net asset value on the date
such items are recognized. Distribution fees are charged directly to the
respective class.

E. Futures Contracts - A futures contract is an agreement between two parties
to buy and sell financial instruments or contracts based on financial indices
at a set price on a future date. Upon entering into such a contract, the Fund
is required to pledge to the broker cash, U.S. Government securities or other
liquid portfolio securities equal to the minimum initial margin requirements of
the applicable futures exchange. Pursuant to the contract, the Fund agrees to
receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the daily
fluctuation in the value of the contract. Such receipts or payments known as
variation margin are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains and losses. Upon
closing of the contract, the Fund realizes a gain or loss equal to the
difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the
value at the time it was closed.

F. Foreign Currency Translation and Forward Foreign Currency Contracts - The
books and records of the Fund are maintained in U.S. dollars as follows: (1)
the foreign currency market value of investment securities, other assets and
liabilities and forward foreign currency contracts ("forward contracts") are
translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the period; and (2)
purchases, sales, income and expenses are

translated at the exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such
transactions. The resultant exchange gains and losses are recorded as realized
and unrealized gain/loss on foreign exchange transactions. Pursuant to U.S.
federal income tax regulations, certain foreign exchange gains/losses included
in realized and unrealized gain/loss are included in or are a reduction of
ordinary income for federal income tax purposes. The Fund does not isolate that
portion of the results of operations arising as a result of changes in the
foreign exchange rates from the changes in the market prices of the securities.
Forward contracts are valued daily at the appropriate exchange rates. The
resultant unrealized exchange gains and losses are recorded as unrealized
foreign currency gain or loss. The Fund records realized gains or losses on
delivery of the currency or at the time the forward contract is extinguished
(compensated) by entering into a closing transaction prior to delivery.

G. Federal Income Tax Policy - It is the Fund's policy to comply with the
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Accordingly, no federal income tax provision is required.

H. Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders - Dividends and distributions to
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.

I. Offering Costs - The Investment Manager incurred offering costs on behalf of
the Fund in the amount of $126,767 which will be reimbursed by the Fund for the
full amount thereof. Such expenses were deferred and are being amortized on the
straight-line method over a period of approximately one year or less from the
commencement of operations.

J. Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2. Investment Management Agreement
Pursuant to an Investment Management Agreement, the Fund pays the Investment
Manager a management fee, accrued daily and payable monthly, by applying the
annual rate of 0.75% to the net assets of the Fund determined as of the close
of each business day.

3. Plan of Distribution
Shares of the Fund are distributed by Morgan Stanley Distributors Inc. (the
"Distributor"), an affiliate of the Investment Manager. The Fund has adopted a
Plan of Distribution (the "Plan") pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Act. The
Plan provides that the Fund will pay the Distributor a fee which is accrued
daily and paid monthly at the following annual rates: (i) Class A - up to 0.25%
of the average daily net assets of Class A; (ii) Class B - 1.0% of the average
daily net assets of Class B; and (iii) Class C - up to 1.0% of the average
daily net assets of Class C.

In the case of Class B shares, provided that the Plan continues in effect, any
cumulative expenses incurred by the Distributor but not yet recovered may be
recovered through the payment of future distribution fees from the Fund
pursuant to the Plan and contingent deferred sales charges paid by investors
upon redemption of Class B shares. Although there is no legal obligation for
the Fund to pay expenses incurred in excess of payments made to the Distributor
under the Plan and the proceeds of contingent deferred sales charges paid by
investors upon redemption of shares, if for any reason the Plan is terminated,
the Trustees will consider at that time the manner in which to treat such
expenses. The Distributor has advised the Fund that such excess amounts totaled
$4,869,930 at January 31, 2004.

In the case of Class A shares and Class C shares, expenses incurred pursuant to
the Plan in any calendar year in excess of 0.25% or 1.0% of the average daily
net assets of Class A or Class C, respectively, will not be reimbursed by the
Fund through payments in any subsequent year, except that expenses representing
a gross sales credit to Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors or other selected
broker-dealer representatives may be reimbursed in the subsequent calendar
year. For the period ended January 31, 2004, the distribution fee was accrued
for Class A shares and Class C shares at the annual rate of 0.21% and 1.0%,
respectively.

The Distributor has informed the Fund that for the period ended January 31,
2004, it received contingent deferred sales charges from certain redemptions of
the Fund's Class B shares and Class C shares of $293,020 and $21,985,
respectively and received $442,244 in front-end sales charges from sales of the
Fund's Class A shares. The respective shareholders pay such charges which are
not an expense of the Fund.

4. Security Transactions and Transactions with Affiliates
The cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of portfolio securities,
excluding short-term investments, for the period ended January 31, 2004
aggregated $541,657,860 and $358,345,450, respectively. Included in the
aforementioned transactions are purchases and sales of U.S. Government
securities of $115,246,729 and $90,652,548, respectively, and purchases and
sales with other Morgan Stanley funds of $666,966 and $199,690, respectively,
including a net realized gain of $4,909.

For the period ended January 31, 2004, the Fund incurred brokerage commissions
of $110,371 with Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc., an affiliate of the Investment
Manager and Distributor, for portfolio transactions executed on behalf of the
Fund.

Morgan Stanley Trust, an affiliate of the Investment Manager and Distributor,
is the Fund's transfer agent. At January 31, 2004, the Fund had transfer agent
fees and expenses payable of approximately $800.

6. Purpose of and Risks Relating to Certain Financial Instruments
The Fund may enter into forward contracts to facilitate settlement of foreign
currency denominated portfolio transactions or to manage foreign currency
exposure associated with foreign currency denominated securities.

                                       61



<PAGE>

Morgan Stanley Allocator Fund
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS [|] JANUARY 31, 2004 continued


The Fund may purchase and sell interest rate and index futures ("futures
contracts") to facilitate trading; increase or decrease Fund's market exposure,
seek higher investment returns, or to seek to protect against a decline in the
value of the Fund's securities or an increase in prices of securities that may
be purchased.


Forward contracts and futures contracts involve elements of market risk in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The
Fund bears the risk of an unfavorable change in the foreign exchange rates
underlying the forward contracts or in the value of the underlying securities.
Risk may also arise upon entering into these contracts from the potential
inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.


7. Legal Matters
The Investment Manager, certain affiliates of the Investment Manager and
certain investment companies advised by the Investment Manager or its
affiliates, including the Fund, are named as defendants in a number of recently
filed, similar class action complaints. These complaints generally allege that
defendants, including the Fund, violated their statutory disclosure obligations
and fiduciary duties by failing properly to disclose (i) that the Investment
Manager and certain affiliates of the Investment Manager allegedly offered
economic incentives to brokers and others to steer investors to the funds
advised by the Investment Manager or its affiliates rather than funds managed
by other companies, and (ii) that the funds advised by the Investment Manager
or its affiliates, including the Fund, allegedly paid excessive commissions to
brokers in return for their alleged efforts to steer investors to these funds.
The complaints seek, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages,
rescissionary damages, fees and costs. The defendants intend to move to dismiss
these actions and otherwise vigorously to defend them. While the Fund believes
that it has meritorious defenses, the ultimate outcome of these matters is not
presently determinable at this early stage of the litigation, and no provision
has been made in the Fund's financial statements for the effect, if any, of
these matters.


8. Federal Income Tax Status
The amount of dividends and distributions from net investment income and net
realized capital gains are determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
These "book/tax" differences are either considered temporary or permanent in
nature. To the extent these differences are permanent in nature, such amounts
are reclassified within the capital accounts based on their federal tax-basis
treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification. Dividends and
distributions which exceed net investment income and net realized capital gains
for tax purposes are reported as distributions of paid-in-capital.

As of January 31, 2004, the Fund had temporary book/tax differences primarily
attributable to post-October losses (capital losses incurred after October 31
within the taxable year which are deemed to arise on the first business day of
the Fund's next taxable year), capital loss deferrals on wash sales and
mark-to-market of open futures contracts and permanent book/tax differences
primarily attributable to a net operating loss and nondeductible expenses. To
reflect reclassifications arising from the permanent differences,
paid-in-capital was charged $179,654, undistributed net realized gain was
charged $110,897 and undistributed net investment income was credited $290,551.

proxies pursuant to authority granted under its applicable investment advisory
agreement or, in the absence of such authority, as authorized by its Board of
Directors or Trustees. A MSIM Affiliate will not vote proxies if the "named
fiduciary" for an ERISA account has reserved the authority for itself, or in
the case of an account not governed by ERISA, the Investment Management
Agreement does not authorize the MSIM Affiliate to vote proxies. MSIM
Affiliates will, in a prudent and diligent manner, vote proxies in the best
interests of clients, including beneficiaries of and participants in a client's
benefit plan(s) for which we manage assets, consistent with the objective of
maximizing long-term investment returns ("Client Proxy Standard"). In certain
situations, a client or its fiduciary may provide a MSIM Affiliate with a
statement of proxy voting policy. In these situations, the MSIM Affiliate will
comply with the client's policy unless to do so would be inconsistent with
applicable laws or regulations or the MSIM Affiliate's fiduciary
responsibility.

     PROXY RESEARCH SERVICES. To assist the MSIM Affiliates in their
responsibility for voting proxies and the overall global proxy voting process,
Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") and the Investor Responsibility
Research Center ("IRRC") have been retained as experts in the proxy voting and
corporate governance area. ISS and IRRC are independent advisers that
specialize in providing a variety of fiduciary-level proxy-related services to
institutional investment managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants, and
other institutional investors. The services provided to MSIM Affiliates include
in-depth research, global issuer analysis, and voting recommendations. In
addition to research, ISS provides vote execution, reporting, and
recordkeeping. MSIM's Proxy Review Committee (see Section IV.A. below) will
carefully monitor and supervise the services provided by the proxy research
services.

     VOTING PROXIES FOR CERTAIN NON-US COMPANIES. While the proxy voting
process is well established in the United States and other developed markets
with a number of tools and services available to assist an investment manager,
voting proxies of non-US companies located in certain jurisdictions,
particularly emerging markets, may involve a number of problems that may
restrict or prevent a MSIM Affiliate's ability to vote such proxies. These
problems include, but are not limited to: (i) proxy statements and ballots
being written in a language other than English; (ii) untimely and/or inadequate
notice of shareholder meetings; (iii) restrictions on the ability of holders
outside the issuer's jurisdiction of organization to exercise votes; (iv)
requirements to vote proxies in person, (v) the imposition of restrictions on
the sale of the securities for a period of time in proximity to the shareholder
meeting; and (vi) requirements to provide local agents with power of attorney
to facilitate the MSIM Affiliate's voting instructions. As a result, clients'
non-U.S. proxies will be voted on a best efforts basis


                                      A-1

only, consistent with the Client Proxy Standard. ISS has been retained to
provide assistance to the MSIM Affiliates in connection with voting their
clients' non-US proxies.


II. GENERAL PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

     To ensure consistency in voting proxies on behalf of its clients, MSIM
Affiliates will follow (subject to any exception set forth herein) these Proxy
Voting Policies and Procedures, including the guidelines set forth below. These
guidelines address a broad range of issues, including board size and
composition, executive compensation, anti-takeover proposals, capital structure
proposals and social responsibility issues and are meant to be general voting
parameters on issues that arise most frequently. The MSIM Affiliates, however,
may vote in a manner that is contrary to the following general guidelines,
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section IV. below, provided the vote is
consistent with the Client Proxy Standard.


III. GUIDELINES


A. MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS

   1.  When voting on routine ballot items the following proposals are

          members be comprised of independent and unaffiliated Directors.

          which may come before the meeting."

   2.  The following non-routine proposals, which potentially may have a
       substantive financial or best interest impact on a shareholder, are
       generally voted in support of management, subject to the review and
       approval of the Proxy Review Committee, as appropriate.


       Capitalization changes

       o  Capitalization changes that eliminate other classes of stock and
          voting rights.

       o  Proposals to increase the authorization of existing classes of common
          stock (or securities convertible into common stock) if: (i) a clear
          and legitimate business purpose is stated; (ii) the number of shares
          requested is reasonable in relation to the purpose for which
          authorization is requested; and (iii) the authorization does not

       o  Proposals to effect reverse stock splits if management
          proportionately reduces the authorized share amount set forth in the
          corporate charter. Reverse stock splits that do not adjust
          proportionately to the authorized share amount will generally be
          approved if the resulting increase in authorized shares coincides
          with the proxy guidelines set forth above for common stock increases.


       Compensation


       o  Director fees, provided the amounts are not excessive relative to
          other companies in the country or industry.


       o  Employee stock purchase plans that permit discounts up to 15%, but
          only for grants that are part of a broad based employee plan,
          including all non-executive employees.


       o  Establishment of Employee Stock Option Plans and other employee
          ownership plans.

       o  Modify or rescind existing supermajority vote requirements to amend
          the charters or bylaws.


       o  Adoption of anti-greenmail provisions provided that the proposal: (i)
          defines greenmail; (ii) prohibits buyback offers to large block
          holders not made to all shareholders or not approved by disinterested
          shareholders; and (iii) contains no anti-takeover measures or other
          provisions restricting the rights of shareholders.


   3.  The following non-routine proposals, which potentially may have a
       substantive financial or best interest impact on the shareholder, are
       generally voted against (notwithstanding management support), subject to
       the review and approval of the Proxy Review Committee, as appropriate.


       o  Capitalization changes that add classes of stock which substantially
          dilute the voting interests of existing shareholders.


       o  Proposals to increase the authorized number of shares of existing
          classes of stock that carry preemptive rights or supervoting rights.

          vote to pass or repeal certain provisions.


       o  Proposals to indemnify auditors.


                                      A-3


<PAGE>

   4.  The following types of non-routine proposals, which potentially may
       have a potential financial or best interest impact on an issuer, are
       voted as determined by the Proxy Review Committee.


       Corporate Transactions


       o  Mergers, acquisitions and other special corporate transactions (i.e.,
          takeovers, spin-offs, sales of assets, reorganizations,
          restructurings and recapitalizations) will be examined on a
          case-by-case basis. In all cases, ISS and IRRC research and analysis
          will be used along with MSIM Affiliates' research and analysis, based
          on, among other things, MSIM internal company-specific knowledge.

       o  Change-in-control provisions in non-salary compensation plans,
          employment contracts, and severance agreements that benefit
          management and would be costly to shareholders if triggered.

       o  Shareholders rights plans that allow appropriate offers to
          shareholders to be blocked by the board or trigger provisions that
          prevent legitimate offers from proceeding.

       o  Executive/Director stock option plans. Generally, stock option plans
          should meet the following criteria:

          (i)     Whether the stock option plan is incentive based;

          (ii)    For mature companies, should be no more than 5% of the
                  issued capital at the time of approval;

          (iii)   For growth companies, should be no more than 10% of the
                  issued capital at the time of approval.


       Anti-Takeover Provisions


       o  Proposals requiring shareholder ratification of poison pills.

       o  Anti-takeover and related provisions that serve to prevent the
          majority of shareholders from exercising their rights or effectively
          deter the appropriate tender offers and other offers.


B. Shareholder Proposals


   1.  The following shareholder proposals are generally supported, subject to
       the review and approval of the Proxy Review Committee, as appropriate:

       o  Requiring auditors to attend the annual meeting of shareholders.

       o  Requirement that members of the company's compensation, nominating
          and audit committees be comprised of independent or unaffiliated
          Directors.

       o  Requirement that a certain percentage of its Board's members be
          comprised of independent and unaffiliated Directors.

       o  Confidential voting.

          and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations.

       o  Proposals that limit retirement benefits or executive compensation.

       o  Requiring shareholder approval for bylaw or charter amendments.

          pill.

       o  Requiring shareholder approval of golden parachutes.

       o  Elimination of certain anti-takeover related provisions.

       o  Prohibit payment of greenmail.

   3.  The following shareholder proposals are generally not supported,
       subject to the review and approval of the Committee, as appropriate.

       o  Requirements that the issuer prepare reports that are costly to
          provide or that would require duplicative efforts or expenditures
          that are of a non-business nature or would provide no pertinent
          information from the perspective of institutional shareholders.

       o  Restrictions related to social, political or special interest issues
          that impact the ability of the company to do business or be
          competitive and that have a significant financial or best interest
          impact to the shareholders.

       o  Proposals that require inappropriate endorsements or corporate
          actions.


IV. ADMINISTRATION OF PROXY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES


A. PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

   1.  The MSIM Proxy Review Committee ("Committee") is responsible for
       creating and implementing MSIM's Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures and,
       in this regard, has expressly adopted them. Following are some of the
       functions and responsibilities of the Committee.

       (a)        The Committee, which will consist of members designated by
                  MSIM's Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for
                  establishing MSIM's proxy voting policies and guidelines and
                  determining how MSIM will vote proxies on an ongoing basis.

       (b)        The Committee will periodically review and have the authority
                  to amend as necessary MSIM's proxy voting policies and
                  guidelines (as expressed in these Proxy Voting Policy and
                  Procedures) and establish and direct voting positions
                  consistent with the Client Proxy Standard.

       (c)        The Committee will meet at least monthly to (among other
                  matters): (1) address any outstanding issues relating to
                  MSIM's Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures; and (2) generally
                  review proposals at upcoming shareholder meetings of MSIM
                  portfolio companies in accordance with this Policy and
                  Procedures including, as appropriate, the voting results of
                  prior shareholder meetings of the same issuer where a similar
                  proposal was presented to shareholders. The Committee, or its
                  designee, will timely communicate to ISS MSIM's Proxy Voting
                  Policy and Procedures (and any amendments to them and/or any
                  additional guidelines or procedures it may adopt).

       (d)        The Committee will meet on an ad hoc basis to (among other
                  matters): (1) authorize "split voting" (i.e., allowing
                  certain shares of the same issuer that are the subject of the
                  same proxy solicitation and held by one or more MSIM
                  portfolios to be voted differently than other shares) and/or
                  "override voting" (i.e., voting all MSIM portfolio shares in
                  a manner contrary to the Procedures); (2) review and approve
                  upcoming votes, as appropriate, for matters for which
                  specific direction has been provided in Sections I, II, and
                  III above; and (3) determine how to vote matters for which
                  specific direction has not been provided in Sections I, II
                  and III above. Split votes will generally not be approved
                  within a single Global Investor Group

                                      A-5

                  team. The Committee may take into account ISS recommendations
                  and the research provided by IRRC as well as any other
                  relevant information they may request or receive.


       (e)        In addition to the procedures discussed above, if the
                  Committee determines that an issue raises a potential
                  material conflict of interest, or gives rise to the
                  appearance of a potential material conflict of interest, the
                  Committee will designate a special committee to review, and
                  recommend a course of action with respect to, the conflict(s)
                  in question ("Special Committee"). The Special Committee may
                  request the assistance of the Law and Compliance Departments
                  and will have sole discretion to cast a vote. In addition to
                  the research provided by ISS and IRRC, the Special Committee
                  may request analysis from MSIM Affiliate investment
                  professionals and outside sources to the extent it deems
                  appropriate.


       (f)        The Committee and the Special Committee, or their
                  designee(s), will document in writing all of their decisions
                  and actions, which documentation will be maintained by the
                  Committee and the Special Committee, or their designee(s) for
                  a period of at least 6 years. To the extent these decisions
                  relate to a security held by a MSIM U.S. registered
                  investment company, the Committee and Special Committee, or
                  their designee(s), will report their decisions to each
                  applicable Board of Trustees/Directors of those investment
                  companies at each Board's next regularly Scheduled Board
                  meeting. The report will contain information concerning
                  decisions made by the Committee and Special Committee during
                  the most recently ended calendar quarter immediately
                  preceding the Board meeting.


       (g)        The Committee and Special Committee, or their designee(s),
                  will timely communicate to applicable PMs, the Compliance
                  Departments and, as necessary to ISS, decisions of the
                  Committee and Special Committee so that, among other things,
                  ISS will vote proxies consistent with their decisions.

ITEM 25. INDEMNIFICATION.

     Pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Registrant's Declaration of Trust and under
Section 4.8 of the Registrant's By-Laws, the indemnification of the Registrant's
trustees, officers, employees and agents is permitted if it is determined that
they acted under the belief that their actions were in or not opposed to the
best interest of the Registrant, and, with respect to any criminal proceeding,
they had reasonable cause to believe their conduct was not unlawful. In
addition, indemnification is permitted only if it is determined that the actions
in question did not render them liable by reason of willful misfeasance, bad
faith or gross negligence in the performance of their duties or by reason of
reckless disregard of their obligations and duties to the Registrant. Trustees,
officers, employees and agents will be indemnified for the expense of litigation
if it is determined that they are entitled to indemnification against any
liability established in such litigation. The Registrant may also advance money
for these expenses provided that they give their undertakings to repay the
Registrant unless their conduct is later determined to permit indemnification.

     Pursuant to Section 5.2 of the Registrant's Declaration of Trust and
paragraph 8 of the Registrant's Investment Management Agreement, neither the
Investment Manager nor any trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Registrant
shall be liable for any action or failure to act, except in the case of bad
faith, willful misfeasance, gross negligence or reckless disregard of duties to
the Registrant.

     Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
of 1933 (the "Act") may be permitted to trustees, officers and controlling
persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, the
Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act
and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification
against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses
incurred or paid by a trustee, officer, or controlling person of the Registrant
in connection with the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is
asserted against the Registrant by such trustee, officer or controlling person
in connection with the shares being registered, the Registrant will, unless in
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act, and will
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

     The Registrant hereby undertakes that it will apply the indemnification
provision of its by-laws in a manner consistent with Release 11330 of the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so
long as the interpretation of Sections 17(h) and 17(i) of such Act remains in
effect.

     The Registrant, in conjunction with the Investment Manager, the
Registrant's Trustees, and other registered investment management companies
managed by the Investment Manager, maintains insurance on behalf of any person
who is or was a Trustee, officer, employee, or agent of the Registrant, or who
is or was serving at the request of the Registrant as a trustee, director,
officer, employee or agent of another trust or corporation, against any
liability asserted against him and incurred by him or arising out of his
position. However, in no event will Registrant maintain insurance to indemnify
any such person for any act for which the Registrant itself is not permitted to
indemnify him.
